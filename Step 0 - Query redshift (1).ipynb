Let us know if you are unable to login on to your customer portal and we would be happy to help.\\nOption 2: Cancellation via Email Assistance (2 working days process)\\nWe can proceed with your request to cancel the policy via email and we just need to verify some details before we continue to cancel the existing policy. Please provide the following information for verification:\\n•\\tDate of Birth of Policyholder:\\n•\\tMobile number of Policyholder:\\n•\\tMake and model of the vehicle:\\nAn automated email and SMS will be sent to you once the policy is cancelled.

It was nice speaking with you. \\n\\nWe’re sad that you’re cancelling your policy, but we are hoping that you’ll keep FWD in mind for your future insurance needs. \\n\\nIn order to expedite the cancellation request which will be processed almost immediately, you may conveniently login to your customer portal or FWD SG app. Alternatively, we can proceed to cancel the policy effective on the date indicated on the LTA letter, which will take 2 working days.\\n\\nOption 1: Using the customer portal or FWD SG app (same day process)\\n\\nWe will cancel based on the date you enter under the last day of cover and the reason for cancellation.\\nPlease take note of the date you enter online for cancellation as we are unable to reinstate the policy once it is cancelled. Let us know if you are unable to login on to your customer portal and we would be happy to help.\\n\\nOption 2: Cancellation via Email Assistance (2 working days process)\\n\\nWe can proceed with your request to cancel the policy via email and we just need to validate the effective date of cancellation against the LTA letter.\\n\\nHere are the steps on how to retrieve the letter via the One Motoring website using your SingPass, once issued by LTA: \\n\\n1.\\tLog On to https://www.onemotoring.com.sg/content/onemotoring/home.html\\n2.\\tClick on ‘digital services’. \\n3.\\tSearch for ‘Enquire Transaction History (Requires Login).  \\n4.\\tYou’ll then be asked to login via your SingPass account + SMS OTP. \\n5.\\tOnce logged in, click on ‘My Account’ -> ‘e-Letters’.  \\n\\nAn automated email and SMS will be sent to you once the policy is cancelled. Subject to no claims, we'll refund 80% of the pro-rated premium of the unexpired period. There will be no refund for any amounts less than S$26.75.\\n\\nThe refund will be credited back within 7-10 working days to the same card that you used to pay for the insurance while it will be in a form of a cheque if you paid on monthly instalment or the credit card refund failed.\\n\\nWe look forward to hear from you.\\n\\nIf you still don’t have FWD SG App, download it now from App Store or Google Play Store so you can purchase and manage your insurance policy with us (e.g. update your personal details, make changes to your policy, download your policy, submit a claim).\\n\\nMeanwhile, stay safe and wishing you an awesome weekend ahead, Nazeer! 😊\\n\\n\\n\\nYours in Service, \\n\\nKrissy\\nCustomer Engagement Team\"}],\n",

You just need to provide your new address details and unit type upon verification, and settle any premium difference that will be triggered by the adjustment.\\n \\nIf you still wish to proceed with a policy cancellation request, you may conveniently login to your customer portal or FWD SG app. Alternatively, we can proceed to cancel the policy via email via email assistance, which will take 2 working days.\\n \\nOption 1: Using the customer portal or FWD SG app (same day process)\\n \\nWe will cancel based on the date you enter under the last day of cover and the reason for cancellation.\\nPlease take note of the date you enter online for cancellation as we are unable to reinstate the policy once it is cancelled. Let us know if you are unable to login on to your customer portal and we would be happy to help.\\n \\nOption 2: Cancellation via Email Assistance (2 working days process)\\n \\nWe can proceed with your request to cancel the policy via email and we just need to verify some details before we continue to cancel the existing policy. Please provide the following information for verification:\\n \\n•\\tPolicyholder’s NRIC (last 4 characters only):\\n•\\tPolicyholder’s Date of Birth:\\n•\\tInsured Address:\\n•\\tUnit Type (e.g. HDB 3-room / Condo 4-room / Landed):\\n \\nAn automated email and SMS will be sent to you once the policy is cancelled.

There will be no refund for any amounts less than S$25.\\n \\nThe refund will be credited back within 7-10 working days to the same card that you used to pay for the insurance while it will be in a form of a cheque if you paid on monthly instalment or the credit card refund failed.\\n \\nWe look forward to hear from you.\\n \\nIf you still don’t have FWD SG App, download it now from App Store or Google Play Store so you can purchase and manage your insurance policy with us (e.g. update your personal details, make changes to your policy, download your policy, submit a claim).\\n \\nMeanwhile, stay safe and wishing you an awesome day! 😊\\n \\n \\n\\nYours in Service, \\n\\nKrissy\\nCustomer Engagement Team\"},\n",

If the last day of cover is more than 30 days before the date of request, we will be requesting either of the following:\\nDocument 1: Official Letter of LTA Notification Transfer of Ownership for vehicle\\nDocument 2: Official Letter of LTA Notification of De-registration of the vehicle\\nDocument 3: Sales and Purchase Agreement\\nYou may retrieve the LTA letter from One Motoring website using your SingPass:\\n1. Log On to https://www.onemotoring.com.sg/content/onemotoring/home.html\\n2. Click on ‘digital services’.\\n3. Search for ‘Enquire Transaction History (Requires Login).  \\n4. You’ll then be asked to login via your SingPass account + SMS OTP. \\n5. Once logged in, click on ‘My Account’ -> ‘e-Letters’. \\nPlease take note of the date you enter online for cancellation as we are unable to reinstate the policy once it is cancelled.

When I moved on to the payment page, there were 3 options given - Visa/Mastercard, Paynow and Grabpay.\\n\\nUnfortunately, I am not able to utilize Paynow and Grabpay. When I select either option, it will just bring me back to the previous date amendment page. \\n\\nDetails are as follows:\\n\\nPolicy: FWD COVID-19 Enhanced Travel Benefit insurance Premium\\nPolicy number: PNTC2021-00004818\\nPayment Method: Credit Card  \\n\\n \\n\\nAs for the Visa/Mastercard option, when I input my card information and clicked 'Pay', it will direct me to this page as shown below:\\n\\n\\n \\n\\nWhen I click on 'Submit', it will return to the previous payment page and state' Your transaction was unsuccessful, please check your details and try again.'

We’re glad to hear that you’ve recovered.\\n\\nIn addition to what Grace has mentioned, our team is taking due diligence steps to ensure that there’s no anti-selection. It could mean, buying a policy or making changes to it as there’s already a known event that may lead to a claim.\\n\\nAfter reviewing your appeal, our Underwriting Team has made a decision as follows:-\\n\\n1.\\tAs a onetime exemption, we have decided to allow the changes from Asean to Asia Region to cover your holiday in Japan and other countries listed under the said geographical region. However, this will be done midway, with effect 17 December 2021 onwards.\\n•\\tRegretfully, we’re unable to backdate the coverage with effect 13 November 2021.\\n•\\tIn this regard, we’re unable to cover the known outpatient medical claim that you’ve incurred on the 16 December 2021 prior to your request, any follow-up visit in relation to the same illness. \\n•\\tWe understand that travel insurance is needed to provide us a peace of mind, especially that your return date will not be until 15 January 2021. The said changes will cover any benefits applicable in the policy that is not known prior with effect 17 December 2021 onwards.\\n•\\tI have attached the payment link of S$ 17.36 for you to make the necessary top up  by 11:59pm today, Singapore time in order to effect the change for your good-self and travelling companion.\\n\\n2.\\tAlternatively, as the policy is deemed invalid, we can extend a cancellation from inception and process a full refund of the premium of S$ 325.68. If you would like to go with this option, kindly revert to my email so we can facilitate the refund back to the same card used to purchase the policy.\\n\\nMr. Uchida, we’re sorry that we’re unable to fully accede to you request and we acknowledge that our decision may have not met your full expectation. Nonetheless, we hope that our team’s decision providing you an extended coverage on the above workaround would still be valuable.\\n\\nFeel free to let me know if you require any clarification, I’d be glad to help.\\n\\nWishing the rest of your trip a pleasant one and stay safe always.\\n\\nWarm regards,\\n\\nJeferson Maleza\\nManager, Customer Engagement Team'},\n",

Let us know if you are unable to login on to your customer portal and we would be happy to help.\\n\\nOption 2: Cancellation via Email Assistance (2 working days process)\\n\\nWe can proceed with your request to cancel the policy via email and we just need to verify some details before we continue to cancel the existing policy. Please provide the following information for verification, and attach a copy of the LTA letter confirming transfer of ownership:\\n\\n•\\tPolicyholder’s NRIC (last 4 characters only):\\n•\\tPolicyholder’s Date of Birth:\\n•\\tType of policy (Comprehensive / Third Party Fire & Theft / Third Party Only):\\n•\\tVehicle Make and Model:\\n\\nHere are the steps on how to retrieve the letter via the One Motoring website using your SingPass, once issued by LTA: \\n\\n1.\\tLog On to https://www.onemotoring.com.sg/content/onemotoring/home.html\\n2.\\tClick on ‘digital services’. \\n3.\\tSearch for ‘Enquire Transaction History (Requires Login).  \\n4.\\tYou’ll then be asked to login via your SingPass account + SMS OTP. \\n5.\\tOnce logged in, click on ‘My Account’ -> ‘e-Letters’.  \\n\\nAn automated email and SMS will be sent to you once the policy is cancelled. Subject to no claims, we'll refund 80% of the pro-rated premium of the unexpired period. There will be no refund for any amounts less than S$26.75.\\n\\nThe refund will be credited back within 7-10 working days to the same card that you used to pay for the insurance while it will be in a form of a cheque if you paid on monthly instalment or the credit card refund failed.\\n\\nWe look forward to hear from you.\\n\\nIf you still don’t have FWD SG App, download it now from App Store or Google Play Store so you can purchase and manage your insurance policy with us (e.g. update your personal details, make changes to your policy, download your policy, submit a claim).\\n\\nMeanwhile, stay safe and wishing you an awesome day! 😊\\n\\n\\n\\nYours in Service, \\n\\nKrissy\\nCustomer Engagement Team\"}],\n",

Just simply click here and use your NRIC and registered email under the policy.\\n\\nHere are the steps to follow:\\n\\n1\\tLog in using your User ID and password;\\n\\n2\\tKey in the OTP;\\n\\n3\\tUnder the “my policies” tab, click on your Car  insurance and then on “manage policy”;\\n\\n4\\tSelect “Cancel my policy”;\\n\\n5\\tProceed to fill in the details and confirm the last coverage date as the effective cancellation date and the reason for cancellation;\\n•\\tKindly ensure that the date is correct, as once it is cancelled we’re unable to reinstate the policy.\\n\\n6\\tClick on Next/Submit\\n\\nWe will refund 80% of the pro-rated premium of the unexpired period if there are no accidents or claims made against the policy. \\n\\nJust to share with you:\\n\\n•\\tThere will not be any refund for any amounts less than S$26.75.\\n•\\tUpon successful cancellation, you will receive an SMS and confirmation email which will notify you the refund mode and amount.\\n•\\tBy default, the refund will be back to the same card used to purchase the policy within 3-5 working days from receiving the email confirmation.\\n•\\tIf you have opted for the instalment plan or if the refund to the card is unsuccessful, you will receive a cheque instead which will be mailed to the registered address in your policy within 7 working days.  \\n\\nDo let me know if you face any issues with the steps above and I will be more than happy to help.\\n\\nShould you need further assistance or clarification, do contact us by clicking on any of the options below, and we’d be glad to help.\\n\\nWe will respond to your email within 2 working days or sooner, whenever possible, upon resuming.

So sorry for calling you at an inconvenient time just now.\\n\\nWe’re sad that you’re cancelling your policy with us but hopefully, you will keep FWD in mind for your insurance needs in the future.\\n\\nIn order to expedite your cancellation request which will be processed almost immediately, you may conveniently login to your customer portal or FWD SG app. Alternatively, we can proceed to cancel the policy upon receiving the requested information and LTA letter as discussed below, which will take 2 working days.\\n\\nOption 1: Using the Customer Portal or FWD SG app (same day process)\\n\\nWe will cancel based on the date you enter under the last day of cover and the reason for cancellation.\\nPlease take note of the date you enter online for cancellation as we are unable to reinstate the policy once it is cancelled. Let us know if you are unable to login on to your customer portal and we would be happy to help.\\n\\nOption 2: Cancellation via Email Assistance (2 working days process)\\n\\nWe can proceed with your request to cancel the policy but for verification and validation purposes, we need the following details and the official LTA letter stating in the letter that vehicle ownership is no longer under your name.\\n\\n•\\tPolicyholder’s registered NRIC/FIN (last 4 characters only):\\n•\\tPolicyholder’s Date of Birth:\\n•\\tPolicy Number:\\n•\\tPolicy Plan Type (Comprehensive / Third Party Fire & Theft / Third Party Only):\\n\\nHere are the steps on how to retrieve the letter via the One Motoring website using your SingPass, once issued by LTA: \\n\\n1.\\tLog On to https://www.onemotoring.com.sg/content/onemotoring/home.html\\n2.\\tClick on ‘digital services’. \\n3.\\tSearch for ‘Enquire Transaction History (Requires Login).  \\n4.\\tYou’ll then be asked to login via your SingPass account + SMS OTP. \\n5.\\tOnce logged in, click on ‘My Account’ -> ‘e-Letters’.  \\n\\nWe also accept a copy of Sales & Purchase Agreement or Vehicle Handover Form, however, it appears that the handover date and time of the vehicle were not available on the document screenshots provided. If based on such documents, cancellation effective date will be based on the day after the handover date.\\n\\nAn automated email and SMS will be sent to you once the policy is cancelled. Subject to no claims, we'll refund 80% of the pro-rated premium of the unexpired period. There will be no refund for any amounts less than S$26.75.\\n\\nBy default, the refund will be credited back within 7-10 working days to the same card that you used to pay for the insurance while it will be in a form of a cheque if you paid on monthly instalment or if the credit card refund failed.\\n\\nWe look forward to hear from you.\\n\\nIf you still don’t have FWD SG App, download it now from App Store or Google Play Store so you can purchase and manage your insurance policy with us (e.g. update your personal details, make changes to your policy, download your policy, submit a claim).\\n\\nMeanwhile, stay safe and wishing you an awesome day! 😊\\n\\n\\n\\nYours in Service, \\n\\nKrissy\\nCustomer Engagement Team\"},\n",

Please provide the following information for verification:\\n•\\tPlate Number:\\n•\\tMake and Model:\\n•\\tMailing Address:\\n•\\tDate of Birth:\\nOnce we receive either of the documents and the details for verification, we will proceed to cancel the policy which will take 2 working days based on the date stated on the LTA letter or the date after the handover date of the S&P agreement. An automated email and SMS will be sent to you once the policy is cancelled.\\nSubject to no claims, we’ll refund 80%of the pro-rated premium of the unexpired period. There will be no refund for any amounts less than S$25. The refund will be credited back within 7-10 working days to the same card that you used to pay for the insurance while it will be in a form of a cheque if you paid on monthly instalment or the credit card refund failed which will be mailed to your registered address on your policy. \\nWe look forward to hear from you.\\nIf you still don’t have FWD SG App, download it now from App Store or Google Play Store so you can purchase and manage your insurance policy with us (e.g. update your personal details, make changes to your policy, download your policy, submit a claim)\\n\\nYours in Service, \\n\\nEvon Thoo\\nCustomer Engagement Team\\n\\nFWD Singapore Pte.

Just simply click here and use your NRIC and registered email under the policy.\\n\\nHere are the steps to follow:\\n\\n1\\tLog in using your User ID and password;\\n\\n2\\tKey in the OTP;\\n\\n3\\tUnder the “my policies” tab, click on your motorcycle insurance and then on “manage policy”;\\n\\n4\\tIf there is a retention of your vehicle registration number, before cancelling your policy, you need to update it first by clicking on “change vehicle details”;\\n\\n5\\tSelect “Cancel my policy”;\\n\\n6\\tProceed to fill in the details and confirm the last coverage date as the effective cancellation date and the reason for cancellation;\\n•\\tKindly ensure that the date is correct, as once it is cancelled we’re unable to reinstate the policy.\\n\\n7\\tClick on Next/Submit\\n\\nThere will be a separate email notification to be sent to you upon successful policy cancellation.\\n\\nHopefully, this settles the matter.

Please have him email using the registered email for his policy, provide the following information for verification, and attach a copy of the LTA letter confirming transfer of ownership:\\n\\n•\\tPolicyholder’s NRIC (last 4 characters only):\\n•\\tPolicyholder’s Date of Birth:\\n•\\tType of policy (Comprehensive / Third Party Fire & Theft / Third Party Only):\\n•\\tVehicle Number:\\n•\\tVehicle Make and Model:\\n\\nHere are the steps on how to retrieve the letter via the One Motoring website using your husband’s SingPass, once issued by LTA: \\n\\n1.\\tLog On to https://www.onemotoring.com.sg/content/onemotoring/home.html\\n2.\\tClick on ‘digital services’. \\n3.\\tSearch for ‘Enquire Transaction History (Requires Login).  \\n4.\\tYou’ll then be asked to login via your SingPass account + SMS OTP. \\n5.\\tOnce logged in, click on ‘My Account’ -> ‘e-Letters’.  \\n\\nAn automated email and SMS will be sent to you once the policy is cancelled. Subject to no claims, we'll refund 80% of the pro-rated premium of the unexpired period. There will be no refund for any amounts less than S$26.75.\\n\\nThe refund will be credited back within 7-10 working days to the same card that he used to pay for the insurance while it will be in a form of a cheque if he paid on monthly instalment or the credit card refund failed.\\n\\nWe look forward to hear from your husband.\\n\\nMeanwhile, stay safe and wishing you an awesome rest of the week! 😊\\n\\n\\n\\nYours in Service, \\n\\nKrissy\\nCustomer Engagement Team\"}],\n",

Let us know if you are unable to login on to your customer portal and we would be happy to help.\\nOption 2: Cancellation via Email Assistance (2 working days process)\\nWe can proceed with your request to cancel the policy via email and we just need to verify some details before we continue to cancel the existing policy.

We have just received an update from the IT Team on the issue, and has just been resolved. I have attached the link for you to activate your account.\\nYou may submit a claim for Damage to Baggage or Personal Belongings\\u202fif your personal belongings got damaged due to an accident, while on your trip overseas. The amount payable will be subjected to limits, depending on (1) the item type, (2) whether you still have the original receipt and (3) the age of the item. For instance, if you are unable to submit the original invoice, the claim limit will be capped at S$50 per article/pair of articles/set of articles. \\n\\nYou can submit the claim online or via our FWD Sg App.\\n\\nYou’ll need to prepare these documents for claims assessment:-\\n•\\tFlight itinerary or boarding pass \\n•\\tBaggage damage report from relevant authorities or service providers (including airport and airline) \\n•\\tProof of denial or partial compensation by the transportation or accommodation providers and/or manufacturers if your damaged item is still under warranty. \\n•\\tColored photographs of the damaged item(s) \\n•\\tOriginal invoice(s) for the damaged item(s) \\nThey will get in touch with you if they need more information or documents and they will advise you from thereon. Claim review would usually take 14 working days to a month depending on the complexity of the case. \\n\\nDo note that claims outcome is subjected to assessment and approval of the claims officer, in accordance to the policy provisions and supporting documents.\\n\\nIf there is anything more we can help you with, just click on one of our contact options below.\\n\\nFor your convenience, if you have already activated your FWD Online Account you may view and manage your policies in the palm of your hand (e.g. update your personal details, make changes to your policy, download your policy, submit a claim) via the FWD Online Service (by clicking here) or the FWD SG Mobile App, available for download from the App Store or Google Play Store.\\n\\nWishing you an awesome evening ahead, stay safe! 😊'},\n",

If the last day of cover is more than 30 days before the date of request, we will be requesting either of the following:\\nDocument 1: Official Letter of LTA Notification Transfer of Ownership for vehicle\\nDocument 2: Official Letter of LTA Notification of De-registration of the vehicle\\nYou may retrieve the LTA letter from One Motoring website using your SingPass:\\n1. Log On to https://www.onemotoring.com.sg/content/onemotoring/home.html\\n2. Click on ‘digital services’.\\n3. Search for ‘Enquire Transaction History (Requires Login).  \\n4. You’ll then be asked to login via your SingPass account + SMS OTP. \\n5. Once logged in, click on ‘My Account’ -> ‘e-Letters’. \\nPlease take note of the date you enter online for cancellation as we are unable to reinstate the policy once it is cancelled. Let us know if you are unable to login on to your customer portal and we would be happy to help.\\nOption 2: Cancellation via Email Assistance (2 working days process)\\nYou may also simply send over either to contact.sg@fwd.com one of the above documents and help us verify some details before we proceed with cancellation. Please provide the following information for verification:\\n•\\tPlate Number:\\n•\\tMake and Model:\\n•\\tMailing Address:\\n•\\tDate of Birth:\\nOnce we receive either of the documents and the details for verification, we will proceed to cancel the policy which will take 2 working days based on the date stated on the LTA letter or the date after the handover date of the S&P agreement. An automated email and SMS will be sent to you once the policy is cancelled.\\nSubject to no claims, we’ll refund 80%of the pro-rated premium of the unexpired period. There will be no refund for any amounts less than S$25. The refund will be credited back within 7-10 working days to the same card that you used to pay for the insurance while it will be in a form of a cheque if you paid on monthly instalment or the credit card refund failed which will be mailed to your registered address on your policy. \\nWe look forward to hear from you.\\nIf you still don’t have FWD SG App, download it now from App Store or Google Play Store so you can purchase and manage your insurance policy with us (e.g. update your personal details, make changes to your policy, download your policy, submit a claim)\"},\n",

Our surveyor noted the engine oil sump is broken and unable to start the engine. Please refer to few photos taken during inspection.\\n\\nFrom the quotation provided by Eurokars, the bulk of the repair cost is from engine replacement ($16,512.40), while the rest of the items are necessary for engine replacement works. As engine replacement requires LTA approval and our panel workshop will have to purchase the original engine from Eurokars, hence parts price differences will be negligible. Hence, the main cost differences if the repair done at our panel workshop will be on labour cost only. \\n\\nBreakdown of labour cost for similar repair work if repair is done at our panel workshop as below: \\n\\n \\tEurokars \\tPanel workshop\\nPerform vehicle test\\t$24\\tNo charge\\nRecharge vehicle electrical system battery \\t$12\\tNo charge\\nRemove & refit engine\\t$2,160\\t$700\\nReplace engine attachment \\t$360\\tNo charge\\nMiscellaneous (sundries)\\t$350\\tNo charge\\nReprogramming \\t$48\\t$150\\nApply VITAS and LTA inspection \\t$500\\t$256.80 (as per invoice)\\nTotal \\t$3,454\\t$1,106.80\\nDifference\\t \\t$2,347.20\\n\\nPlease refer to below claim settlement amount for your Own Damage claim (SKL2609M):\\n\\nParts \\t$17,842.30\\nLabour\\t$  1,106.80\\nTotal \\t$18,949.10\\nLess OD Excess \\t$      800.00\\nClaim payable\\t$18,149.10 (before GST)\\n\\nWith the above, please inform Eurokars to proceed repair of your car and kindly forward to us the copy of final invoice and receipt once you made the payment to them.

Our surveyor noted the engine oil sump is broken and unable to start the engine. Please refer to few photos taken during inspection.\\n\\nFrom the quotation provided by Eurokars, the bulk of the repair cost is from engine replacement ($16,512.40), while the rest of the items are necessary for engine replacement works. As engine replacement requires LTA approval and our panel workshop will have to purchase the original engine from Eurokars, hence parts price differences will be negligible. Hence, the main cost differences if the repair done at our panel workshop will be on labour cost only. \\n\\nBreakdown of labour cost for similar repair work if repair is done at our panel workshop as below: \\n\\n \\tEurokars \\tPanel workshop\\nPerform vehicle test\\t$24\\tNo charge\\nRecharge vehicle electrical system battery \\t$12\\tNo charge\\nRemove & refit engine\\t$2,160\\t$700\\nReplace engine attachment \\t$360\\tNo charge\\nMiscellaneous (sundries)\\t$350\\tNo charge\\nReprogramming \\t$48\\t$150\\nApply VITAS and LTA inspection \\t$500\\t$256.80 (as per invoice)\\nTotal \\t$3,454\\t$1,106.80\\nDifference\\t \\t$2,347.20\\n\\nPlease refer to below claim settlement amount for your Own Damage claim (SKL2609M):\\n\\nParts \\t$17,842.30\\nLabour\\t$  1,106.80\\nTotal \\t$18,949.10\\nLess OD Excess \\t$      800.00\\nClaim payable\\t$18,149.10 (before GST)\\n\\nWith the above, please inform Eurokars to proceed repair of your car and kindly forward to us the copy of final invoice and receipt once you made the payment to them.
