       " \"good afternoon speaking, how may I help you? Okay um I know Devon Okay yeah okay I've got this motorcycle insurance which is actually expiring on 29 of october. Oh okay and my text is expiring on 17 september. Oh okay so there's uh like a misalignment uh Alright I see. Okay let me double check first on your uh policy with us, May I have your vehicle number? 346346 You Okay thank you. Okay what's the make and model of your bike? Uh Super for super for Honda I see. Okay and your uh your email address with us is Lemon underscore 12 at live dot com. You all right give me a moment to just check the policy details so let me check um by the way what is your uh mobile number also even 96551074. Okay Alright uh indeed your policy is expiring 29 so now I need to confirm against the one monitoring site. Uh let me see if I think you need to either just extend first or uh extend or renew and then do some extension if you're are you renewing road tax for one year or six months? Six months? Okay all right let me take a look first. Okay let me see six months as per the one monitoring side. Mhm It's showing us yeah, expiring 17 september so if you renew for Six months uh it should be your policy must be valid until March 2022 17. March 2022 should be your policy expiry date so that it will match. Okay, so but uh October November December January February March March, hold on I'm because there's a maximum period for policy extension. So let me check if it's within that oh is it? Okay, give me a moment and let me just count as well. Uh So uh end of october and then november december january february March March 17th. Actually you should be able to uh but you have to choose maybe you chose beyond 17 March did you try uh you try to do on the portal, is it Uh Yes correct correct. Can you uh while I'm on the phone, can I can I can you try again and then choose specifically the new expiry date of 17 March, see if it because it's still within the 180 days. So supposedly it should, I mean it should be accepted, it should be accepted. Sure. No problem. I wait on the line and you're doing it on the website, Right. On the version. Okay ken okay, okay, it says something went wrong, Something went wrong. Uh Okay. Uh When you chose 22nd, March, March 2000 I think did you try earlier on as well? And uh you reached this page also, did you see the same error earlier previously you never tried, I just want to see them but there was no there was no option. Okay, let me just check the back end here. Uh if there was any, uh, you know, because if it's clashing with another attempt attempt to do extension before, uh then it will not allow you, uh, you have to do it on that side. You hold on for a few moments for me while I check on this place. Okay. Thank you. You are on hold. Thanks for waiting. Hello? Okay. I tried to check but there's there's really no, uh, no other requests clashing with it. So by right. It should so uh, no, I think it's a it's a error with the I. T. Error or bug that's affecting this. So Okay. Can you try again one last time? If it really doesn't work, then, uh, I will just request for it to be manually sent to you the payment link to extend your policy. So uh yeah, that one is through email then you will click the link to make payments, and then, uh, you will receive a updated policy document after your payment like that. Yeah. So this one you try first because this one is easier and, uh, faster, able to get her idea. Okay. Good. So I'll just wait on the line while, uh, while you complete, uh, so that just to ensure no no more errors because sometimes I want to do it after my Okay. Also Yeah. No problem. Okay. I see. Okay. The anyway, there's no urgency, right. Because it's only gonna be by, uh, september 17th. So um yeah. No problem. So once I once I extended it, how long does it take for the process? It's almost immediate meaning uh after your payment, right uh because after this choosing the date you will see a payment screen and it will show you the amount supposedly. Okay and then you can straight away make payment within 30 10 to 30 minutes you should receive already the updated policy document and then uh depending on the time of your payment we will transmit to L. T. A. Uh accordingly want to safest would be 1 to 2 working days. So maybe if you do the extension do with three working days before the the line, I mean that's the latest you can do that. So I got time to transmit to L. A. For you first. Okay thank you. Thank you so much. Okay no problem. Okay so for now you don't don't proceed to to the next page so that it wants slash next time when you try again. Okay. Okay. All right. You're welcome. Is that all for today or anything else I can check for you? Okay, Happy weekend to you and stay safe. Thank you. Is it okay to invite you to rate my service before you hang up, is that okay?

So I just wanna understand whether my medical insurance covers personal accident. Oh uh okay. If it's the maid insurance, you're referring to the FW made insurance. Uh It's actually include all the types of plants, Right, includes the minimum requirements from M. O. M. In reference to personal accident, hospitalization as well as the security bond. So I'll double check for you the status of your policy first. So I can sure can I have your icy or the policy number percent? Uh Yeah. Uh it s 84 double two double 08 France. My number. Okay, thank you. Give me a moment. Yeah. Made palace. Okay. And what is the helpers name and the country she's from? Uh her name is Venita. She's from India. Uh is that her name? The her only name? 1, 1 word only is it? Uh just give me a moment. Let me just check. Hold on. Thank you. Hello. Yes, I'm here Sharma Anita Sharma Anita. Thank you. And what is the email address you have registered with us S dot underscore Nyr at yahoo dot com. Thank you. And for this policy that you bought for her. Uh or but uh yeah for the insurance uh How many uh what is the period of coverage, is it for 14 or 26 months is it for a one year or two year contract for two years, 24. All right so uh yeah it should be 26 because there's always a two months buffer. Alright sure. So I found the matching policy this one started sixth or it's a renewal? Right? Uh sixth of november. Okay so uh actually even the original policy itself because it's just a renewal, so exactly the same as the previous one, uh it already includes personal accident coverage of 60,000. So this one you can see on the table uh on the policy documents uh did you receive the policy document? Well that's a cover note so I I'm supposed to submit some documents to M O M. And the claim that I did not attach the document, which shows personal accident policy of coverage of 60,000, so I'm not sure which document. Oh it's actually this uh I'm not sure what did you submit to them, is it only the first page or something or the whole first page? Uh Okay then that that would be the reason why because the details of the uh coverage, right, there is a like a table of benefits over there included on the same stack of policy back so let me just open uh so I can direct you which pages it that uh yeah usually for made policies, work permit application and all that right, they they they get this other page that shows the personal accident coverage. You give me a moment, I checked the email, are you in front of your email? No I'm not I'm not in front of my email. I recall the actual documents uh one would be the the color page, single page providing a summary, which is the one that I submitted to M O M and I understand from you that may not be the correct one. And there's another document which is the uh insurance policy itself, I think a lot of details go into it. Ok. Yes, yes that's that's where the information will show. Uh you just hold on, I'm trying to pull up a copy of the documents we sent you uh you got the document where is it from the email or the on your online account? Uh percent may I know uh I got a document from my application and downloaded from the from the app I see. Okay so uh yeah because in the app you have the option to just download the cover page, you know the summary and then the invoice separate documents because the one I can find from my end is the in the email it's a whole stack, it's like altogether the documents, so uh let me open that hold on email document, it comes with a secure encrypted password. Right, so I wouldn't be able to send that over to them, you know what what other people do is they just because they only need the table of benefits, they just do screenshots of it and then they so that they can include it on the uh file that they need to upload on the M O M site. Yeah, but uh yeah but that's correct you you do have the option because the online from the downloading uh through the app or the portal, right? No need for password that one. So better I'm just letting you know that uh my access right now is only through the email I uh so I need to enter your password first so that I can you just hold on so your password would be Your I see and then you're born 1984. Right, Okay, let me just enter oh I looked through the uh I mean before uploading the summary table summary, one piece cover note to M O M actually had a look at the detail proposal, the entire policy so but there's no mention of my helpless name in the needed as it speeds the period of insurance because in M O M reply the indicated that uh the personal accident insurance is the document that indicates amount cover, which is minimum 60 key period of insurance and the name of the policy holder because it's together one as mentioned just now it's a whole stack right supposedly. Uh so uh the the first page which shows your uh policy holder details and the helper, the helpers details, right? Should really be sent together with the it's like a supplement, I suggest let's send all the documents to uh to M O M. Not only the summary cover note as well as the detail proposal. Uh Yeah the one with the the amount and the benefits are not necessarily the you know the policy were doing the definitions and all that not not necessary. The uh what do you call it? The the those are the only two pages or two uh sections of the policy document that most people will upload and should be fine and accepted by M O M. Oh okay. Alright. Well could you refer to refer supposed to upload? Okay, sure, sure, no problem. Let me sorry because the system is still loading uh hold on you hold on for a few moments for me let me just check this one for you, you are on hold, you are on hold. Thanks for waiting. Hello? Okay okay I was able to check already loaded. Um Okay so on the policy wording it would be on page uh Page seven. Okay because this is including the tax invoice and everything, so let me count first one four K Page 4 & five. Okay. Page point yeah, no problem. Uh Yes there are actually 22 pages so it's the title on top should be quick summary of your benefits. Okay and then uh you will see their security bond, all the other benefits. Right. And then on the second page, uh except here uh personal accident, 60,000 funeral grant liability to third parties. It shows it shows on the second page there's no need for the help of, need to be on the screenshot. Right. Uh no. When you submit you, you submit the first page again, the insurance summary with the details. Yeah. And then uh you can attach the, the pages that we mentioned just now. No worries. Okay. Is that all for today or any other things? Okay. Take care, stay safe. Once again, this is chrisy. Bye.\",\n",

Yes. Okay. Okay cool. Alright anything else I can do for you uh Okay you mentioned about if there's no claims what if there's a claims against it? Uh Alright let me check for you for this policy specifically. Sure is there are claims right, Let me see something's going on with uh the policy I believe they should be a claim that be mean but unfortunately unfortunately it's not being made to like make no trust black and white because I don't know he's been taking so long like these these uh incident that happened was probably set out in April earlier this year and it's been taking so long I think I'm starting to get a little bit frustrated with like that uh they're not fully putting out like the claims because I don't want this claim to go beyond anything else that is not supposed to be like if the claim is just like a straight out and we shall like that and then we'll get the payment set up but it seems to me that they are delaying. So I don't know it's it's been since April I don't think you should take that long like it's almost the end of the year now. Yeah I understand. So this is for the here in one case is it mister the one where your car was parked there and it was a hit and run, was it that one for this car that's one that's me claiming against the energy went off and then we have, I have a witness will have the number, the number of people like the investigation obviously isn't following up with me for anything, so I don't know what's going on here. Okay. Yeah so usually when you're making a claim against the other party for the case, right? Is your workshop that is doing the claim on your behalf? So for that case you would need to follow up with your work. So you need to tell them, hey, what happened to my case? Are you guys coming from the insurance? Okay? As for the other accident which I'm looking at right now, if you just hold on for me, I'm waiting for the patient. It's the one is it? I believe it's the Earth Street open when the third party of two clothes and collided. Oh no, yeah. Okay. Let me have a look. Mhm. This is the one on two April 2021, one hmm. Inquiry to we have I hated liability inform. Oh wow there's a lot of updates for this one. Hold on what I need to check. Just give me a moment please and sure I need to I need to have clarity, especially for that case because they they sent out an email on that and I've been waiting on to to settle on everything but they they're not they're not getting back on me at all. I see. I'm sorry to hear that. Just give me a moment. Let me have a quick look at the policy type mm mm There's a lot notes on this one. I'll tell you what, allow me to get the claim officer to give you a call back because there really is a lot of uh to and fro and a lot of this for this case uh by looking at the summary of the case, I am really unable to a certain what's the next step or what is the current situation for this claim case? I need to get the I've just got in, I mean like I think a couple of months back um I received an email uh informing that this could be turning into uh personal claim because um the insurance doesn't cover whatever it has happened whatsoever. So I'm like sure, fair enough but I'm just waiting for them to follow up with um like a proper black and white personal came but isn't coming on at all. So I don't want like like you know if any um like extra assessments with me to the car uh with regards to the damages that I did not like cause however it's supposed to be because it's it was, I mean like humidity the lady was at fault by following by the rules and regulations according to the officer investigation officer, like whoever is parking this also like yeah there's a lot of like you said, so I'm just waiting for that to uh be forward to me so I can certainly once cause I wanna close this case and I want to let go the insurance once is that I see? Okay so if you say that you have uh an officer to follow the case with me then that's fine because I'm sorry ma'am I gotta be off for work now so Okay so uh we'll get my claim officer to call you directly instead of your mom is so we'll call this contact number confirming as per the one called in is 9204991. So uh required from the claim officer, is there any is there any way I can get him to call me on my order number, Which number do you prefer us to call you on If I'm gonna be providing you one now (915) 212 76 91 five. Uh huh 212 212 7676. Let me repeat that 91521276. Yes correct. Okay um So the thing that is required from our end to concern if can slim from the policy cash because from my notes I noticed previously right, this one um happened because the previous policy before the renewal, it was actually for a let me see the one that is previously, yep it's a classic plan, yep, the classic plan that was without the anyone to drive your car, right? So this part I can see from the case claim and I noticed that after that the action chicken home inform we have appreciated liability, submit survey report on on the basis on repudiated liability liability, which means that the claim officer confirming that we cannot uh cover for it. Okay. Yeah. Yeah, correct. I noticed she did send one to you as well. Uh let me no claim requested them to some meal survey report team. Okay. So let me retrieve that from my system. If I could see. So at least I know what I really I'm really sorry, but I've got to be right now, so uh yeah, if there's any then just maybe get him to call me on the number one I've given you earlier. Okay. Okay. Just trying to make a call to the number that was uh I'm more active on the second number. That's why I see. I'll give the number. I asked him to try the one that you've given to me first. So basically what you get from them on this case is whether if there's anyone I want to get it then Yeah, this one. Okay. Okay. Can I will get them and then thank you so much. Thank you.

Um There's been a bit of a change in the travel so is it okay to cancel the travel insurance and then repurchase it. Uh Yeah you can either do that or can depending on how what is the gravity of the change? Is it moved to a much later date or something? Um It's been extended extended? Oh so you mean the policy already started? Can I maybe I'll give you the insurance policy? Sure go ahead. I see your policy number can Okay I see it S 7301963 Z.

Okay and how many people are insured inside the policy? 2, 2 people. Yeah. Alright and lastly your email address please Caitlyn pong at gmail dot com. Alright thank you. So okay looking at the insured, I found a matching insurance policy so indeed 26 to 8 so you mean instead of uh until eighth uh it needs to be extended to uh much I'm actually leaving leaving past midnight on the 27th now change of flight uh So there is a need to move move and um let me see Red returning on on the 10th I think. Let me take a look. Uh Okay then uh yeah if there is a change of uh uh flight details or itinerary Yeah you can uh I mean to make it much cleaner instead of because we can also raise a request for endorsement but it may be quite confusing because there will be an moving of start date as well as an extension, right? Because from the original trip duration of 13 days. So maybe it would be better to just uh by the replacement policy with a new your new travel uh details. And then uh you can uh cancel the the the first one you bought since it hasn't started yet, you can get full refund for the premium and uh of course subject to no claims. You're not submitting any claims against the policy has been traveled. Yeah yeah because uh for uh yeah you just need to highlight that uh it's subject to no claims and uh it cannot be reinstated in in case you change your mind and wants to use the policy again. So you can just log in uh to cancel that right after you we would suggest you buy the replacement policy first so that you can just be sure that you have the insurance in place and then you can log into your online account. Did you activate it before Caitlyn? No. Oh you did not let me just double check. Oh you did actually, you did, you did uh you did and then on the online account is tagged to the your I see.

       " \"I'm speaking, how may I assist you? Hi sorry who's that? Uh My name is pam P. A. M. Hi, my name is okay, how can I assist you? I have a um I received emails for some change of policy with W. D. Can you help me track if it has updated it correctly for the coveted coverage as well coverage. Okay. Alright so for this answer in order for me to pull out the record in our system, can I know sir, which policy do you have with FW D. Uh travel travel insurance? Okay, do you have the okay let me just uh pull out the person sir uh for the travel insurance sir, when is the travel date that you have provided? It's 18th December 2021 November 18 December December December. So for this uh the contact number sir that you have provided uh during the time that you have purchased, is it the same contact number? Yeah. 97281882 9728 1882. Okay hold on let me just pull out the record in our system for a moment. Okay and just to do a simple verification with you can I have your contact I mean your date of birth? Uh 23rd july 1975. Okay and how about the last four characters of your 2398 and lastly sir, what is the coverage that you have selected the travel region outside of us outside of us? Okay, thank you very much. So for this one sir you have purchased a new policy is it can you hold on Because upon checking so you have this COVID-19 coverage. And what is the changes that you have done on your policy? See originally I purchased a single policy I looked up and they said you can only buy covered for single travel policy. So I went and bought a single travel policy first. Now I put in a start date of 18 december. I thought the single travel is like a normal one month. I did not put any end date. Anyway, I made the payment, it was very small payment of something like $32 or something for maybe it was just one day, right? And I did not know it was only for one day, but anyway I did that policy and then I added on a covered policy for which I think I paid another $88. Okay, so it also attached to the same policy for one day, probably that once it was done after that I realized that it's actually ending on the same day it starts. But my travel plans in Europe extended second or third of january. Okay. Alright. And so I went in 19th of november, I made the changes to extend the single policy to go from you know, 18 december till third of january asked me to pay 1 $15 more. I made the payment to pay, it did not recognize anything, it did not update any statements, just five minutes back, I received an email from wd that finally it has been updated, although if I go to the website and put in my login id as of now it is not showing any updates to my policy, but if I download the policy document of 8898 policy number, it is showing that my travel policy has been updated to but that's the main policy for which I paid $152 extra. Now the add on was with for Covid now is the add on for Covid valid for the same period as a travel, so I don't have to pay any extra or do I have to pay extra for covered? Also that's my question. Okay, Alright so for this because we have notified you that we have already received your payment, so upon checking the coverage that we have here, firstly that the check first when it comes to your travel insurance, at least we can check it one by one. Okay, Alright so for this upon checking the travel insurance that you have with us with the policy number ending with 898 okay, the coverage period that I have here sir is december 18th 2021 until january 3 2022 which is correct. Right, alright and then let us check right now when it comes to your travel insurance to make sure that everything is okay. Okay, can you check if the coveted covet is also for the same period because I did buy the add on Covid policy, right, that's what we need to check now. Alright sure sure hold on. Alright so upon checking for this one sir, the policy coverage for the travel insurance with the COVID-19, this one is actually ending with the same date of the start date, which is November 18, 2021. Okay how do I change this? Do I have to go onto the internet to make the changes? Can I change this? Okay, can you try to log in sir on our W D. S. G. F. So the same thing that you have done with your travel insurance, if you can also extend the policy until the third of january, so while I'm on the line we can also if it will be successful or not, but do I have to pay extra for this again correct? Because I paid I've paid a lot of money already. Yeah because for this one the coverage for your policy is only for one day and then uh of course automatically our system will also generate a premium. If let's say for example we are going to extend the trip duration from December 18 to to january of course that would be a different premium. Your website doesn't even work properly, I'm trying to sign in on the website, it doesn't let me sign it, have you tried using the or the using the app is not working properly? Okay, pretty bad. Okay now I'm on the website going in Okay yes on the website even for the single first policy number 898 ending in 898, it is still showing me the expiry date is 18 december 2021. It has seems like your I. T. Team has not updated actually it is updated already, it's just that since that is the original policy that will be recorded. Right, but you may refer to the email that you have sent you where you can actually download the updated policy sir because that is an endorsement policy already that's why we send you a separate email for that, but it would show me the old date only at the beginning for the for the new email sir that we have sent you right yesterday I believe that one will be an updated period of insurance already. Okay, it's asking me for money and when I click on the website it doesn't let me select that. Why is that okay, is there any other like is there any like pay now grab pay these three options, I click on anything it highlights and then disappears, there's nothing that happens, what do I do? Okay for the for the option of credit card, you cannot also uh select that correct? Yeah it it says first would you like to save your card for future purchase if I say no it takes me to another page. Okay, no matter what I say if I click it's not letting me pay? Okay well what if I cancel all my policies and buy a new one, why don't I do that? Also can also sir, so at least for the one sir, since you have purchased this policy, let me double check. Okay so for this uh 18, since it's still under the feel look right and of course the policy hasn't started yet, so you can actually proceed to cancel the policy and you can purchase a new one with the correct period of insurance er to make it easier, so you're fine. Okay it will take five working days. Do I have to chase uh for that one sir? If let's say for example uh it will be refunded back to the same uh mode of payments or that we use so we didn't find that and working conditions. So I use I think now can you check how did I pay for this? Which one sir for this uh current policy has anything for anything I'm currently checking, can you hold on? Okay so upon checking sir, the payment that you use? Right, it's uh P announcer all the time. Yes correct. Okay now I'm going to, so I requested for a cancellation, does it show in your system so far it doesn't let me double check for you sir? Okay so for the travel insurance and for the coveted travel insurance, it is canceled already it is already reflected in our system, it is correct. Okay so aside from this, is there anything else that I can assist you with? So when when do I get the money back for this one? Since you have used the piano? Right, it will be credited back within 5-5 to 10 business days. 5-10 business, is is there any faster way I'm sorry again sir? Okay so it's asking me again for the same thing $201 to pay upgrade so I being Okay get covered for COVID-19 108.55 up to 30 days before your trip during etcetera etcetera, add cover. Okay I'm adding that cover, let's continue nothing else Next my details, can you just be with me for another one minute? Sure, no problem sir. Okay, Okay asking me for the entire policy about $310 single trip insurance for family of twitter's and two Children traveling worldwide, excluding us in december 3rd january covered proceed to pay. Okay now sorry the service available right now mm Mhm what do I do? Baby the bank so it's not letting me if I need to use the scan right there is another way to do it, is there no number? Okay um for the support mobile banking app that supports scan the Q. R. Code, it's not scanning somehow. Oh is there any other options? Uh no is there any other other options for you to do the payment number number? This normally works? I don't know why it's not working. Okay man, you cannot be okay tend to R A P Y. D. Holdings, is that correct? Yes correct sir. The rapid one, is it correct? Oak seems to have gone okay on your website and training. It's processing. Okay, I got some some details. Maybe this thing should work. Okay. Alright, good to hear. So is there anything else that we can assist you with? No thanks very much. No problem. Thank you very much. And have a nice day. Thank you.

Okay so I do a cancellation online and then purchase a separate one for each of the members ma'am if the refund upset upset refund in terms of the refund miss you. Oh it will be processed back to the same card that you have used to buy the policy. If it feels then automatically will issue a refund via check so it's a separate transaction number policy.

Uh you can email the copy of the certificate through uh contact SG through it. Give me the give me the password, I think uh that one better idea actually that one is the more preferred option because you just need to set up your own password and then you can log in right away, so I'll just do that for you then uh one I'll email it to your outlook, okay, activation email then I will uh yeah you from there once you set up a password, you can simply log in one and then there will be an option to manage your policy and cancel directly any issue You, you can always let us know, then we can always go for the next option.

Uh It's just that you have to make sure you are entering the correct uh full I see an email address okay to be able to reset the password successfully. So uh can I confirm that also the mobile number, is it the 97934472, is that his mobile? Yes, yes it will be sent to him, that's why you can do it later once because anyway he's the only one who can cancel or must request for cancellation of the policy so as long as uh he's already available you can also choose the date there of the effective date of cancellation. Okay. Uh and then uh you will instantaneously you should be receiving a uh like it will show on the screen also on the any refund amount eligible for canceling the policy early. Okay. Uh that one is subject to no claims and subject to 80% of the unused period, minimum of $26.75. Yeah. Okay. Alright. And then later if uh any issue with the online cancellation and all that? Okay. Uh Alternatively you can ask your uh that to send over a copy of the uh the registration letter from LTA. Okay. And then attach a copy of that and then uh on the email and then send it over to us then we will forward to another team for processing. Alright. Yeah. Okay so you you you just ask him to try first the online because that one is faster because if it's through us, we also need to forward to another team first then you have to wait for three working days and all that.

Okay I I have two policy number, one of it is P. N. T. Okay P. E. N. T. C. C. P. N. T. C. 2021-00002334. Uh four zeroes. Right 40. Okay. Alright one will do for now. Uh may I know how may I address you please? I'm Fadela. Okay thank you for give me a moment to retrieve ya. Yeah sure thank you. Uh sorry is it 2234 or 2334 Me too. 2334 2334 And there are four Zeros on there. Yes. Okay sure thank you for let me see here. So uh what what are the what's the nature of your enquiry first. Okay so I would like to take actually when you purchase this inquiry Germany but because of recent issue right? Uh we will be changing destination and one of the person in this policy will no longer be going for the trip. So I would like to do, I'm checking it, can we cancel in person and then change destination or must we cancel the policy and again? Oh okay alright uh actually let me check on the policy details first before I advise you, okay on the best way to uh to take. Okay may I know what is the how many people in total actually Uh for your insurance for this insurance? For 5, 5 people? Yeah. And the travel dates please? 15, 15 5th december to 15 december. Uh Okay and alright you said just now uh Okay. Uh What about the email address you have registered please? Uh Fadela underscore at yahoo dot com. Thank you. And last four characters of your. I see. Okay, so you're also one of the insured? Right? So meaning you're one of them. Okay. Alright so I see here the rest of the insured. Okay so since the policy is uh Okay only by 5th december. Okay because of the changes, right, there are two changes you you need. Okay and it cannot be a removal of the insured may not be possible to uh as a valid amendments on the insurance. So um but I mean the Germany wise it's where are you going now? I mean what's the new destination? It still falls under the same category. So actually no need to change change region because the region you have chosen before is because we we doesn't go by country, it's by region. So your chosen region is world excluding uh usa so as long as you're not going to us, any part of the U. S. Or transiting there then no need to change actually. But because of the but the because of the removal of one person, right? Uh I it would be best to actually buy an entirely new policy with the intended insured so that it will be uh Yeah. And then uh anyway it's only by is there any change on the dates also because one of the person, I mean she's not well so we decided because now you know, understand the change and destination destination, I understand, I completely understand that. So uh yeah, so that would be a better way to go since it's uh it's still uh quite a long, I mean a lot of weeks to go before the cancellation of the policy. Okay. For cancellation wise, did you uh the easiest and most convenient way? Uh fastest way is through the online portal. Have you activated your online account? Uh No, I did not know what to do by the phone for over the phone, is it actually I don't have the authority to do cancellation. We can only forward it to the policy servicing team. So that's why uh if if you want that option it's okay I can forward it to the policy servicing team but uh it will take longer than 2 to 3 working days for you to receive a confirmation that it's processing. Yeah, so that's the one of the difference. So if you want urgent or immediate cancellation uh we advise that because there's like a cancel button when you log into the online account and you can see already the confirmation email that it's been canceled should be uh should be within the next 5 to 10 minutes after you click on the so I customer portal, I sign up for the I sign up on my own is actually no, we already said we should have already sent you the activation email, uh by the way, when did you, when was this the email? Um but then what what do you mean? Because when I see the email right. The only the only right like we can download the policy document but it's a separate one. Uh it should be the title is your online services account, but that one is only being sent to uh to uh first time policyholders with uh let me check on your records, Let me help you out. Okay. You give me a moment, yeah, thank you. So I need to go by or I see. Okay. Oh okay. I see that you have also purchased a travel insurance in 2018, your eyes is included. Uh so it was sent then a 2018. Uh so then since you did not activate it then it already expired for the link, so I'll just send you a new one but I have forward, yeah, I'll have to forward it from uh different email or do you still have access to the M. D. Underscore North? Oh you still have yes, yes, it will be sent to that email but if you want to change it to something else later then you can do so after you log in. Okay, okay so that one is good then the customer service uh Yeah the online uh cancellation is a faster way to do it uh since you will immediately see the confirmation. Yeah so let me just hold on now you give me a moment to check again. I'm just trying to generate a new one. Oh but that time you also uh you also purchase with other people, other people. Yeah.

Uh uh Hi good afternoon because I'm calling uh regarding my uh car insurance that bought earlier this year because I've been buying duty for the previous two years or so. So this year will be the third year. So I realized that the coverage is wrong because just now I tried to renew my my uh my text right then insufficient thinking how come so I realized that uh this is earlier by a month.

Yeah Sean okay let me just check for you give me a moment. Sure so currently your policy expiry date is 21st of january 2022 for you to be able to renew your text for six months period, you need to have the policy until 21st of february 2022. Yeah correct so it's about one month so uh what you can do is to extend the policy um because we can no longer change the date but what you can do is to extend the policy until 21st of february, 2022 how you can do that is actually via the customer portal via D F W D S G F. Okay. Under manage policy, there's an extension uh extended ended. Okay. So meaning uh using the app, is it uh that's correct using the app or the customer portal from the website Customer? Okay, let me recall your login.

Alright. Alright. You're welcome. Is there anything else in the meantime I can assist you? Oh okay. No, no, so so sorry the other thing would be because uh my previous two other policies, we always have been on the february, so that means this time, I mean something was wrong meaning correct could mean that you selected the start date wrongly s 22nd of january I believe because you purchased it on the top of january meaning on the same month. Okay. Okay. Okay, so then that that can be okay. Got it, got it extend, sorry, sorry then we extend right then how do they calculate the extended month? Uh it's based on the premium that you paid, so depending on how many number of days extended. Yeah, so based on the number would be extension immediate. Okay, so once you extend?

Um I took out an insurance, a travel insurance policy and no matter which way I try and log in or retrieve or anything, it doesn't let me um get into it during uh with the app, I've got an email um and I've got a policy number but we've also cancelled our trip and moved it to the summer. So I wondered whether I can either cancel or amend the details and and change it to the new travel dates. Okay?

Oh but how is that your number or you have used number instead of the let me check. Oh did I book this before? No I booked this after I got my sin. I've changed the pr but I'm sure I booked it with my pr number and not my old thin but I can give you that it's um my old phone number was uh 215 T. Okay, thank you.

Yeah, because the one we have in our system is 1313 Is what the 13 June 13, 1983. Maybe when you purchased the policy sir, when you have entered the details you've entered it wrong. D but don't worry for this one regarding the policy sir, your travel dates will change right? Yeah, so we want to change the original. The problem is I originally booked an annual policy and then I was told the annual doesn't include the cover cover so I need to book a single trip, so I canceled the annual cover and booked a single trip. And then now we've had to cancel the trip and so we've we've moved the flights to june july next year. So what it's a longer period so it'll be more expensive but I would ideally like to change the dates and just pay to um and I'm I'm well and then also I've booked a trip in March as well so um I don't know whether I go to an annual one but if I could just change the dates and pay the difference. That would probably be the easiest way forward. Oh because uh for this one it's quite very long. One moment.

Right, why? Uh the policy document? Yes, that is the welcome email. Uh you did not receive no. And then the second one is for me to enable to use the correct Okay, this is actually on the same email Yeah, it's actually on the same email but before you can access that there is a separate email sir, that we have sent you to activate now. No worries. Let me forward, let me retrieve the email now so that I can forward that you this one here is another issue portion where I can enter my number and then the day of year just the year, year of birth? Yes correct. Yes correct. Yeah, I download pdf but it keeps saying error, I can't I can't open it, do you have access to it now and then I guide you on how to open may I confirm? Okay, just want to confirm sir, when you enter the password for the pdf file, did you use the password open open? Okay. Uh my my wife managed to send me the email because oh okay, I can change for the second email, can you send it to me? Yes sir, I'm actually in the process of retrieving it now I'll forward you the online activation email in a bit. Okay so for this particular one, once you manage to activate, Okay by the way when you receive the email, it will ask you to enter a password. So since this is your first time you can create your own password. Uh it must be a minimum of eight digits and then a combination of capital and small letters and a number. Okay. Yes. Uh simple also can include as well so when you uh once you have created sir you can log into your online account. Okay, this one even you can just go directly to the fW D uh websites or there is a log in button and then from there there was uh once you managed to log in, you can actually click under manage policies and then uh you can submit the request to update the date of birth only. Okay, so there's an option for you to do that, but at least whenever you need to access your documents, manage your policy would be able to do it uh once you have activated the account sir, so I'm going to forward you the email uh in at least five minutes, so you should be able to receive it now so that would be great aside from this area. So by the way once you manage to activate online, okay, uh usually within one or two working days you will receive a revised certificate that will reflect your correct date of birth. Okay. Okay okay can I ask you about something about this personal accident policy brief information is normally like my wife and my daughter, my daughter, she fell claim medical fee or Okay let me check accident accident yes. For accidents or uh you're under your plan. Okay. Uh your wife actually purchased the 500,000 plan. Okay so for yourself, Okay uh in terms of medical inpatient or outpatient expenses because of an accident you're covered up to $10,000 for the child is half of the benefit, it's up to $5,000 for inpatient and outpatient expenses because of an accident. And then uh this one aside from accident, the policy also includes a coverage for uh infectious diseases. Okay uh but there is a waiting period of 90 days. Okay so if let's say for example there is a medical expenses incurred because of an infectious disease, like maybe a Covid 19 I have to go for inpatient or outpatient treatment then this benefit is entitled to 50% of the benefit you are claiming for. So if let's say for adult that because of covid 19 medical treatment, then the 10,000 it will be uh to 50% so 50% of 5000 coverage for yourself for infectious diseases for the child, it's 2500 coverage for infectious diseases. So by the way um I've already forwarded the email to you sir, would you like to check if I stay on the line for us? Sure. Sure, sure, no worries. Thank you. That's awesome. So from there sir, just have to click on the link to activate it and then as soon as possible sir, please submit your request to actually update the from the inside, by the way. Just to share with you as well. Mr ALF in for the Covid 19. The infectious disease coverage I mentioned to you other infectious disease there is a waiting period of 90 days but Covid 19 we cut down the waiting period to 15 days, so it's much harder for the coverage I'm just curious about aside from this, is there anything else I can help you with?

       " \"wd good afternoon, this is speaking, how may I assist you? Hi, good afternoon, I recently bought travel insurance policy from FW D. But I just wanted to um check whether did I get the coverage uh because I realized that the coverage is an add on? Right. Yeah, so can you help me check if um that writer was added into my policy because I think I was rushing through, so I'm not sure if I if I edited on can I have your name sir? You are uh my name is Mr Jeffers, could I confirm your full name and date of birth? Uh Mama Jeff have been up to lock 30th April 1990. And just to confirm is the start and end of your trip. My start date is 29 November, my end I believe is seven January. Okay so from what I could see for your current travel insurance from five August until sorry bear with me that's not coming from the 29th november until the seventh of january 2022, it actually exceeded the 40 day period as such, we are not able to add on and cover for the Covid 19 coverage. It will not cover for any Covid 19 related uh situation so I can recommend is that is to log into your online account to process the cancellation, full refund for your policy. Bear with me while I check if your account was activated to process the cancellation. Alright yep Once I cancel the policy I can book um the full refund will be back to the same card, useful payment, I would recommend you check with other insurance company because your trip is more than 30 days and for the COVID-19 writer to be added in it has to be 30 days and below. Oh okay why why Because our underwriters and actually as far as management has looked into it and that's where um they have come to the conclusion that 30 days is the maximum we can cover for COVID-19-related trips, and travel it may be revised um in the future but as of now it still Spence So okay so what happens if I were to adjust at in the COVID-19 for 30 days of the of the policy uh it will be considered invalid because even if you are just the dates for example you declare 10 days lesser instead of seven january, maybe you put about 27 of December, therefore the two days of the trip, right? Um but the date you return is seven of January, it will avoid the whole contract because the end date is not accurate as per your boarding class so we will not be covering it. Okay so the coveted 19 coverage is uh specific to um if I get coveted overseas or once I if I get it if I'm back is it is is that how that works Um how it works, is that if your trip is less than 30 days and your diagnosis, COVID-19 in Singapore itself, you can submit a claim for cancellation if you're diagnosed overseas. Oh here I'm sorry, overseas if you're diagnosed overseas will cover $400 300,000 Singapore dollars medical expenses uh for your medical expenses incurred overseas as well as when you come back to Singapore, It's 100,000 Singapore medical expenses coverage. Alright, But having said yeah, go ahead, go ahead. I would recommend that you check other insurance company because I think they are this will cover up to 50 days or 40 days for the travel. So it's just follow FWT specifically currently we only cover 30 days. Okay, okay, so that means the current policy I have with you guys for the travel insurance only covers it covers my entire trip without the benefit. Right? Yes. Okay. And which means uh if let's say if I were to get medical assistance overseas, you still will cover me, but as long as I believe is that what you're saying? Yes, that's correct. Mr jeffers, but having said that it's best for you to check with uh travel insurance because it's not just the medical expenses that could occurred, you say for example you are diagnosed touch with if I'm diagnosed with Covid 19 in Singapore, I will have to cancel my trip all together, which means the hotel, the flight activities you pay for, you need to send me for that. So usually for travel insurance it does cover for that, it's just the four hours in particular, we don't have the coveted portion of it for this travel. Yeah, so I would still recommend that you check with other insurance company, you still have time um as long as you activate your account, which I'm gonna get you how to do so now because I notice you haven't activated yet Just bear with me on that and then later on you can log in in your in your convenience as per your convenience to cancel the policy if you manage to get a travel insurance with other insurance company that covers for your 14 day trip. All right, okay and um I noticed that when I booked this policy online, there wasn't any alert to tell me that yeah, so that that is not on my end, right? Because I think if that was then I would have seen it, but I think my payment went through and everything went through, it's just that when I wanted to print out because I'm traveling with my wife and she had a lesser than 30 days. So that's why she got to like documents to print. We had one, that's correct because um for this one right in relation to that, uh the page actually has the part this is this does not include Covid 19, but that's not in the main page is actually on the second page when you generate the code, This is the COVID-19 outbreak, considered a non event and when you for example got the trip, which is more than 30 days, there will be no an option available for you to click on to top up for so I think that's what happened for this policy Yeah. Okay, so what I'll do for you, I'll get you how to activate your account uh if you have time and in front of your pc can we do it together just to make sure you are able to activate it with our areas? Yeah, sure. I'm at your website right now, let me see first policy was purchased recently Okay, let me check, yeah, and can I verify your email address as well at Hotmail dot com. Okay, I'm checking for the activation email, Let me see when was this purchase? This was purchased nine of November this couple of days ago there we go, I need to put you on hold because I'm looking for your activation email. Alright, just a short moment thank you. You are on hold, you are on hold, you are on hold, you are on hold, thank you for holding. So sorry to put you on hold okay um forward the activation email to your email address. Mr java, could you kindly check if you receive any email from me, it will be sent from contact SG yes, that's the one as your corporate contact and if you can just scroll down to the um email that says customer portal Manager policy of East. There is underlying here, which is orange in color. You need to click on that uh Sure it's under my signature. Where do I find it again? The signature if you see stay safe and healthy. Always wishing you awesome. We go ahead, that's my signature. Right. If you scroll below uh there will be another email there. Uh Yeah. Okay. So if you see the orange color here that's underlying there, just click on that and you should be diverted to our website to set up a password you can remember. Uh Yes, I'm so just set up your password, but then it's just a normal like a website that I would go in. Yes, it looks like that, but you need to set up the password first by setting up the password, you're activating your online account. So that later on when you want to cancel your policy or you want to check your policy or submit a claim, you can log in to the FW online account or the FWD mobile app. Okay. Uh am I supposed to see uh a problem that um and password or something like that, uh once you get, it will be activated here. New password, confirm, password? Oh no, I don't see that. Okay, so what I see in your signature, right is your name and then the stuff and then there's a there's like a picture that tells me purchase a manager policy through FWD and then below that I see, email us your contact number and call me back, I don't see uh the okay you found it. Alright awesome, awesome. Okay so I just have to type password right? Mhm. Just give me a second, no worries, take your time. Okay so I received a P. Okay let me put that in. Okay. Yeah so um so I click on my policy under my policy, you will see your travel insurance there. So when you're ready to cancel it, for example if you manage to find Other insurance company that covers for the full 40 day trip. And they also include COVID-19 benefits as well. You can actually click on manage policy Okay and then cancel so once you click cancel, right, the process is immediate, you will get a pop up to say uh filling the reason of cancellation, like not traveling anymore. Um found better coverage elsewhere. Example and then uh if as long as the policy has not started yet and you have requested for cancellation, The process will be immediate usually within like five minutes or so you will receive a cancellation confirmation email to say that this policy has been cancelled, refunded back to the same card, useful payment and pretty much uh we believe that the amount should show on the same day in your card details how we cancel uh things that we buy online, the credit amount immediately back to our car, it should be so unless of course your bank will take a bit longer to process such refund request. Alright okay and you're saying that um if I were to cancel this before the policy starts, which means that until the 28th of november 28th of november to actually do so if you want to be sure because um sometimes customer have issues logging in and things started and 28 is actually a Sunday if you call us uh you might not be able to come through to us because we don't work on sunday, I would recommend just to make sure everything is fine. Try to do the cancellation on friday which is 26 we are here nine in the morning until 10 in the evening. If you have issues logging in, we can still put in a request from outside but it will take two working days to process. That's all Okay I understand. Uh Can I also clarify that the coveted um Writer right is mandatory only for those with any of the vitale flight? Uh We believe it's best to have because it's not just a matter of going on V. T. L. Flights even if it's not a V. T L. Uh country right? We still cover there's more in the event touch wood if the insured is tested positive for Covid 19 right so that's the reason for in mm Okay Okay um Alright okay yeah sure thank you so much.

       " \"good afternoon speaking, how may I help you on how to make a claim on my students personal accident? Okay, let me uh assist you on that ma'am. May I just have your uh details first? I can check for you. Thank you. Okay what's your I see your policy number ma'am. Uh my number is S. 7400531. D. For Denmark 531. Okay how may I address you Just you can just call me Pc or miss. Thank you. All right thank you. Miss lee one moment. Personal accident. Okay. How many people are insured inside your personal accident policy myself? On yourself And your uh email address is pola at uh Hotmail dot com. Thank you. What about your uh do you remember your sum assured for your personal accident? I think it's 100 K. 100 K. Okay thank you so much. I found your matching policy. So uh you mentioned you need to submit a claim, is it uh like a medical for outpatient medical expense? Yeah that's right. Because what happened is i this is my actually my first time uh cleaning after so long uh this last saturday this last day I have a fall and actually my my arms and my hands. I'm sorry to hear that. Thank you very much. That's why I went to a polyclinic because I have a follow when I went to uh you can get everything close. I need to go on a Tuesday. Tuesday uh Tuesday to do extra, so Tuesday I went to do X ray. Uh luckily quite quite quite likely they say there's no factor or anything good. Yeah but the issue is uh I'm still suffering from pain and and and and selling. So I am thinking of going for a second opinion which is uh which is going for another doctor, which is the appointment for tomorrow. This whole thing works and get all the amount and claim or what what am I supposed to do? Alright, submission of claim wise Miss lee it's uh you can submission, the window period is within 30 days from incurring the charge or from the actual accident date so you can uh you can do so you can send the submit the claim first for the initial visits and all that. Uh And then if you have any like follow ups or related outpatient visits for the same accident, you can just submit it later as a follow up claim related to the same accident. So you can just register the claim first for now uh for the one that you finish already, you already have the receipt right? You already paid for the then you can submit it online directly. Uh I'm just checking if you have activated, do you remember logging in before miss lee because I want to because I didn't know that I I just need to have 1% accident but I have 2% accident, different companies I see I just wanted to check whether do I have mm Okay yes so uh since you can log in uh there is when when you see the policy uh reference there, right, there's a submit a claim option so you can just click on that and then uh it will you just fill in the fields required, required and then there would be a recall upload documents section uh and then you can just submit so once that is completed you will also receive on a confirmation email with the claim reference number. So that means your claim already registered and they will uh process it within normally 14 days or uh to a month, depending on the complexity of the claim, could I just show you what what what what documents do I need to to do something other than my receipt to a letter from the doctor indicating that has informed him that came and it was really because of my accident mm Yes uh because if it's not uh normally it's not on the receipt, right? So uh I mean if you do have the any medical related document, I suggest you just submit them altogether but uh later on uh I mean the the main thing is the receipt. Okay but if the claim's officer deems it necessary uh during their processing right to uh to update additional information or clarification on what that receipt is for then they will uh inform you separately with the claim reference also. Yeah but but I would suggest whatever you have for now you just submit together and then uh let's just see how it goes when the processing the claims processing officer uh Yeah checks the documents you have submitted and the details, would you be okay if I left my apartment with another doctor's uh can I just go to that then after that I submit together? Like maybe tomorrow after Oh yeah, it's up to you, as long as as mentioned within 30 days from the incurring the charge, uh you submit and also to avoid to avoid losing the, you know the receipt and all that. So yeah it's but it's up to you if you want to do it tomorrow also can since it's still within the timeframe. Okay that'll be maybe just once but at least you know you know how to go about it already. Thank you. Thank you appreciate your assistance. Thank you very much. Not a problem is leave right now, is there anything else I can check for you? Uh that's why that's why I just wanted to know how this whole power has been so many years but that's something also right. But that's something that means you're not usually having accidents. So feel I hope you are the injury is uh you know, the pain will go away very soon so that you can be 100% again. Thank you very much appreciate that. No worries. Okay. Anyway if anything you just uh call us again, contact us again, we'll be happy to assist you. Okay? Thank you very much. You. Thank you. Bye. Take care, stay safe. Okay. Once again, this is Christy.

       " \"Good afternoon speaking, how may I help you? Hi this is Alexis um I'm calling with regards to a travel related claim, the website and the app is both down. Oh uh so you mean you cannot proceed with the purchase of it uh the claim so uh once I click on submit it will say error and it's the same on the app as well as on the website. Oh okay sorry about that. Uh Okay let let me pull up your details first and then I will advise you on maybe an uh the alternative way to submit the claim since this is uh there's an ongoing issue. Can I have your I see your policy number please ma'am uh my which one policy or I see either one uh so that I can pull up your records. Yeah. Okay. Uh maybe the policy is T. N. T. R. Okay 2021 Alright zero 6464 6464. Thank you, how may I address you ma'am Alexis, Alexis, Alexis. Uh But I mean for the on the policy, how what's your full name indicated? Alexis, Strong India. Okay thank you Alexis. Uh Let me see policy. Alright so how many people are insured inside this policy please? 1 1, okay and the travel period uh is six November to I think 13 or 14 November. I remember how about your email address, Alexis J. At gmail dot com? Alright thank you so much. Alright I found the matching policy, let me just see any reports regarding claim so you tried via the app and the online version but it's the same same, exactly the same area. The submit button after you click, it doesn't go through the next the confirmation page, is that right? Um after I click submit, there will be a pop up that says that there's an error, I can take a screenshot of the app but on the website and there is some api issue yeah the api expired mm. Okay. Alright. Uh Alexis is it okay if uh are you still on the website right now on the in front of a P. C. No but I can be okay yeah because the two other options left would be to submit through the online form without logging in uh because the bug is uh I checked the report and there was a bug reported already for the online access meaning after you log in that particular button indeed is causing some issues or yeah so it's still being fixed by our I. T. Team but the online uh web form uh that's the part where you can just key in first the details, the policy number and your your personal information and then you can upload also the documents from there. Uh Yeah yes can so you just need to go to online right so instead of signing in, you go under claims and then uh there will be uh two options there so click on the don't have an account, click here to get started, yep, yep and then click travel. Mhm. Yes and then click uh which which one you're claiming from under the main travel or the under covet 19. Alright and then uh I'm on this page now but then actually under the policy number um it says P. N. T. R. 20 yep. Then you just continue the 21 21 dash. Oh okay then Okay yes correct. And then uh yes you can just follow the prompts. Okay and then uh this one there's no reported issues with the submit so hopefully it goes through uh uh but maybe I can give you for now I can also give you the last alternative just in case it's uh to email directly to claims team but that one is the last option, last resort because it will take longer for them to register manually, the the claim, so that's that's claims dot S G mm at fwd dot com, mm. Okay. Yeah. Um Yeah and and then I have another related question which is uh for my wallet was actually stolen overseas in Italy. So I came back already I felt a police report in Italy um I've also found a local police report for my I see, so my question is for this travel claim right? Um definitely there was money that was stolen, but there's also I guess my personal belongings which is the wallet and uh the icy and place together token and some credit cards. So with that uh which option can I do multiple claims on the same policy for multiple items. Yes. You can uh you just submit the uh the supporting documents for the items that you're claiming or it would be best if you want to uh to also provide any supplementary, you know, maybe in writing or something like that after you submit the claim and got the claim reference number. Normally they will also review first what you're claiming for uh claiming for based on the, you know, the, the receipts, the police report. Yeah, it will be itemized there anyway. So later on they will uh the claims officer to be assigned to your case will be reaching out Okay. If they need for the clarification or verification, then you can go from Della, there will be a direct correspondence. Direct correspondence with a claims officer. Yeah. And then in let's say in the type of money when you fill in the full sum that I wish to claim or just up to the policy amount that I'm allowed, you can either way is fine. So if it's uh if you can put their the actual amount that has been lost. Okay then you think was lost and then uh later on if they review then they will just pay out is just to let you know that of course, regardless of how much it is, then we'll only pay up to the maximum amount as per that. Okay. Yeah. Um And one last question, I'm not sure whether you know this whether it's under your purview but um let's say I lost my N. R. I. C. And um on a website they say that I have to pay $100 for replacement on the first law, but there was nothing on it about stolen. I see and whether I need to pay for it I've contacted ICA but they have not gotten back because I think right now they are flooded with um all the different issues. So I'm just wondering in the I. C. Replacement cost is that something that can also be claimed? Uh Well because for loss of, I'm not sure if that can be considered because the the I understand that under our policy wording, right, it's just as travel documents, right, passport travel documents but for uh an R. I. C. The personal belongings, personal belongings, uh I would suggest you just send it in together if you if you already have the receipt uh so that they can take that into consideration when processing the claim because outright I cannot advise if it's uh gonna be falling under the category. Yeah. Okay but because the idea is not getting back to me, I I'm not sure whether I should just continue to apply for a replacement and pay for it, so I can get a receipt wait for them. Uh And then I I'm I'm sure whether it might be outside this 14 day period. Um I'm supposed to file the claim so little bit but not necessarily, it's within 30 days. Okay. And uh as long as you have already registered, I would suggest you register whatever uh whatever it is that you are claiming as of now and then the rest can be like a supporting claim or like a related claim already. So as long as you can, as long as you can register your claim first for the within the 30 days period upon your return. Okay. Okay. That's good. Yeah. Okay then uh All clear, I have no more questions. All right. Okay. All right. So you just try no problem. Alexis. So you just try that first and then if uh any issue you can just email directly to the email address just now. Okay. Okay. Thank you. Okay. Alright for now. Anything else, nope. Okay. You take care stay safe and well, Alexis. Bye. You're welcome. Bye.\",\n",

Online survey also cannot using the wipes uh user name or is it your own? I see. No, my wife under my wife. Okay, can I confirm sir uh what is the user uh what is the error message that you are getting message again so long? Uh Okay. Uh you see that the id of password? Oh okay. I see um if that is the case, may I confirm uh what is the mobile number uh that you are using your wife is using under the policy?

Uh when you try to log in uh Mr 10 Yuki in 427 G. And then your mobile number, correct? Okay, if that is the case if that is the case where it is possible that it's uh because of the password, if just in case you are unable to remember the correct password sir, are you able to click on the retrieve password button? Just it's just below the password, boxer Captain. Yesterday. Okay, whenever we keep the number, the full the full the full ones including including the S. I. Try my wife, I see. Right. Um Yes. Uh huh The owners and then the email address provided an email address. I tried all these three d. Mhm. Yesterday okay now I submit it is yes sir, that's on my own. Yes sir. Okay, so it's uh a new password? Well the new must be must be minimum of eight digits and then a combination of upper and lowercase letters, number and a symbol or a special character. Oh, so many numbers and special characters. Maybe I opened the password possibly yesterday because the exact details of the policy sir, because of P D P. E. I am not able to disclose but I can guide you on how to do the cancellation? Okay, okay, okay. Open up open so once you are inside Mr Tan uh there was already an option for you to submit the cancellation of the policy. So just to share with you Mr 10 for the policy sir, once it's cancelled, uh you will also receive where the policy holder will receive an email notification or confirmation into working days. And this was usually uh we will refund 80% of the unused portion. As long as the premium is not below $26.75. Uh but this uh refund is subject to no claims or no benefits paid out under the policy. So if there is any accident or any type of benefit out then there will be no refund provided. Okay so how do I go to cancer cancel this one? Are you able to find the policy? And then is there a button for manage policies? Oh my policy just hold on. Okay then Okay can I just cancel my policy? Right, yes yes correct Last year of coverage today yesterday correct reason for cancellation I got a uh scratch my car Okay mm Okay name Okay So the 80% refund to go to my bank account or what received on my bank account? Okay this ones are usually it's back to the same debit or credit card used to buy the policy but if it fails then it will be uh sent via check to the policy holder's name. May I confirm Mr Tan, is there any claim or benefits paid under the policy? Anyone? Uh it was there any accident or uh any any claim made under the policy like windscreen accident? Nothing in it, no accident. Uh huh. How about windscreen shirt? The screen? I did change one, change one side. Okay. Um because if there is a windscreen benefit paid out sir, uh there will be no refund under the policy as well if it is canceled, did we 11 time front windscreen sir, it will not affect the N. C. D. But it is a benefit that is speed under the policy. So as per the policy wording sir, the terms and condition if there was any type of benefit or claim that is speed under the policy, then there will be no refund in the event uh the policy is cancelled midway. So most insurances would have this terms and conditions regarding things now to get a new car will be able to change to the new car um for the insurance or it's not transferable to uh to any other vehicles for the new car, a new policy would have to be taken up for yet. Oh thank you very much happy to assist you sir. Once again, my name is Irish. You have a good day ahead. Thanks, happy to help. Thank you. Bye Bye. Bye.\"]"

You all right give me a moment to just check the policy details so let me check um by the way what is your uh mobile number also even 96551074. Okay Alright uh indeed your policy is expiring 29 so now I need to confirm against the one monitoring site. Uh let me see if I think you need to either just extend first or uh extend or renew and then do some extension if you're are you renewing road tax for one year or six months? Six months? Okay all right let me take a look first. Okay let me see six months as per the one monitoring side. Mhm It's showing us yeah, expiring 17 september so if you renew for Six months uh it should be your policy must be valid until March 2022 17. March 2022 should be your policy expiry date so that it will match. Okay, so but uh October November December January February March March, hold on I'm because there's a maximum period for policy extension. So let me check if it's within that oh is it? Okay, give me a moment and let me just count as well. Uh So uh end of october and then november december january february March March 17th. Actually you should be able to uh but you have to choose maybe you chose beyond 17 March did you try uh you try to do on the portal, is it Uh Yes correct correct. Can you uh while I'm on the phone, can I can I can you try again and then choose specifically the new expiry date of 17 March, see if it because it's still within the 180 days. So supposedly it should, I mean it should be accepted, it should be accepted. Sure. No problem. I wait on the line and you're doing it on the website, Right. On the version. Okay ken okay, okay, it says something went wrong, Something went wrong. Uh Okay. Uh When you chose 22nd, March, March 2000 I think did you try earlier on as well? And uh you reached this page also, did you see the same error earlier previously you never tried, I just want to see them but there was no there was no option. Okay, let me just check the back end here. Uh if there was any, uh, you know, because if it's clashing with another attempt attempt to do extension before, uh then it will not allow you, uh, you have to do it on that side. You hold on for a few moments for me while I check on this place. Okay. Thank you. You are on hold. Thanks for waiting. Hello? Okay. I tried to check but there's there's really no, uh, no other requests clashing with it. So by right. It should so uh, no, I think it's a it's a error with the I. T. Error or bug that's affecting this. So Okay. Can you try again one last time? If it really doesn't work, then, uh, I will just request for it to be manually sent to you the payment link to extend your policy. So uh yeah, that one is through email then you will click the link to make payments, and then, uh, you will receive a updated policy document after your payment like that. Yeah. So this one you try first because this one is easier and, uh, faster, able to get her idea. Okay. Good. So I'll just wait on the line while, uh, while you complete, uh, so that just to ensure no no more errors because sometimes I want to do it after my Okay. Also Yeah. No problem. Okay. I see. Okay. The anyway, there's no urgency, right. Because it's only gonna be by, uh, september 17th. So um yeah. No problem. So once I once I extended it, how long does it take for the process? It's almost immediate meaning uh after your payment, right uh because after this choosing the date you will see a payment screen and it will show you the amount supposedly. Okay and then you can straight away make payment within 30 10 to 30 minutes you should receive already the updated policy document and then uh depending on the time of your payment we will transmit to L. T. A. Uh accordingly want to safest would be 1 to 2 working days. So maybe if you do the extension do with three working days before the the line, I mean that's the latest you can do that. So I got time to transmit to L. A. For you first. Okay thank you. Thank you so much. Okay no problem. Okay so for now you don't don't proceed to to the next page so that it wants slash next time when you try again. Okay. Okay. All right. You're welcome.

Okay alright just before you do anything else, just to check with you, do you remember having a claim against your father's motorcycle insurance? Uh someone's claiming against my father? Oh okay okay the reason I asked that question is because I wanted to share once the policy is cancelled and there is a pending claim there will be no refund for the policy. Okay so so once once the because if another party were to claim for me then after that then I can sell this then of course yes of course. Yes yes yes yes yes. I'm just saying about the refund uh so that you won't be surprised why there is no refund so that would be the reason. Okay. Okay but should I wait until the uh party finish the entire situation or or I can just cancel it now you can cancel right now because uh we would still settle because the fact of the matter is the incident happened before the cancellation of the policy. Okay. Okay. Yeah. I just wanted to share about the refund just in case you might be wondering so right now, can you see the policy number ending in 3000 three triple zero. Okay, wonderful. Can you see the manage button button for me manage policy? Yes. Okay. Please click for me. Uh huh. And then on the next page it ask you last day of cover?

And what is the email address you have registered with us S dot underscore Nyr at yahoo dot com. Thank you. And for this policy that you bought for her. Uh or but uh yeah for the insurance uh How many uh what is the period of coverage, is it for 14 or 26 months is it for a one year or two year contract for two years, 24. All right so uh yeah it should be 26 because there's always a two months buffer. Alright sure. So I found the matching policy this one started sixth or it's a renewal? Right? Uh sixth of november. Okay so uh actually even the original policy itself because it's just a renewal, so exactly the same as the previous one, uh it already includes personal accident coverage of 60,000. So this one you can see on the table uh on the policy documents uh did you receive the policy document? Well that's a cover note so I I'm supposed to submit some documents to M O M. And the claim that I did not attach the document, which shows personal accident policy of coverage of 60,000, so I'm not sure which document. Oh it's actually this uh I'm not sure what did you submit to them, is it only the first page or something or the whole first page? Uh Okay then that that would be the reason why because the details of the uh coverage, right, there is a like a table of benefits over there included on the same stack of policy back so let me just open uh so I can direct you which pages it that uh yeah usually for made policies, work permit application and all that right, they they they get this other page that shows the personal accident coverage. You give me a moment, I checked the email, are you in front of your email? No I'm not I'm not in front of my email. I recall the actual documents uh one would be the the color page, single page providing a summary, which is the one that I submitted to M O M and I understand from you that may not be the correct one. And there's another document which is the uh insurance policy itself, I think a lot of details go into it. Ok. Yes, yes that's that's where the information will show. Uh you just hold on, I'm trying to pull up a copy of the documents we sent you uh you got the document where is it from the email or the on your online account? Uh percent may I know uh I got a document from my application and downloaded from the from the app I see. Okay so uh yeah because in the app you have the option to just download the cover page, you know the summary and then the invoice separate documents because the one I can find from my end is the in the email it's a whole stack, it's like altogether the documents, so uh let me open that hold on email document, it comes with a secure encrypted password. Right, so I wouldn't be able to send that over to them, you know what what other people do is they just because they only need the table of benefits, they just do screenshots of it and then they so that they can include it on the uh file that they need to upload on the M O M site. Yeah, but uh yeah but that's correct you you do have the option because the online from the downloading uh through the app or the portal, right? No need for password that one. So better I'm just letting you know that uh my access right now is only through the email I uh so I need to enter your password first so that I can you just hold on so your password would be Your I see and then you're born 1984. Right, Okay, let me just enter oh I looked through the uh I mean before uploading the summary table summary, one piece cover note to M O M actually had a look at the detail proposal, the entire policy so but there's no mention of my helpless name in the needed as it speeds the period of insurance because in M O M reply the indicated that uh the personal accident insurance is the document that indicates amount cover, which is minimum 60 key period of insurance and the name of the policy holder because it's together one as mentioned just now it's a whole stack right supposedly. Uh so uh the the first page which shows your uh policy holder details and the helper, the helpers details, right? Should really be sent together with the it's like a supplement, I suggest let's send all the documents to uh to M O M. Not only the summary cover note as well as the detail proposal. Uh Yeah the one with the the amount and the benefits are not necessarily the you know the policy were doing the definitions and all that not not necessary. The uh what do you call it? The the those are the only two pages or two uh sections of the policy document that most people will upload and should be fine and accepted by M O M. Oh okay. Alright. Well could you refer to refer supposed to upload? Okay, sure, sure, no problem. Let me sorry because the system is still loading uh hold on you hold on for a few moments for me let me just check this one for you, you are on hold, you are on hold. Thanks for waiting. Hello? Okay okay I was able to check already loaded. Um Okay so on the policy wording it would be on page uh Page seven. Okay because this is including the tax invoice and everything, so let me count first one four K Page 4 & five. Okay. Page point yeah, no problem. Uh Yes there are actually 22 pages so it's the title on top should be quick summary of your benefits. Okay and then uh you will see their security bond, all the other benefits. Right. And then on the second page, uh except here uh personal accident, 60,000 funeral grant liability to third parties. It shows it shows on the second page there's no need for the help of, need to be on the screenshot. Right. Uh no. When you submit you, you submit the first page again, the insurance summary with the details. Yeah. And then uh you can attach the, the pages that we mentioned just now. No worries. Okay. Is that all for today or any other things? Okay. Take care, stay safe. Once again, this is chrisy. Bye.\"},\n",

Um So I believe the email was sent out to your email address, I think if one wished at gmail dot com.

Alright sorry they ever cancellation fee or anything like that? Yes definitely for cancellation before the policy expired provided daniel claims whatsoever. Okay the refund is 80% of the balance on news period and must be above $26.57 Must be about $36, 57 cents. 26.57 6.57 Yes correct so the penalty fee is 20% of the news period because we're refunding 80 So it must be above $26, and then the 20% of the yes correct? 20% of the news period? Yes. Okay. Okay cool. Alright anything else I can do for you uh Okay you mentioned about if there's no claims what if there's a claims against it? Uh Alright let me check for you for this policy specifically. Sure is there are claims right, Let me see something's going on with uh the policy I believe they should be a claim that be mean but unfortunately unfortunately it's not being made to like make no trust black and white because I don't know he's been taking so long like these these uh incident that happened was probably set out in April earlier this year and it's been taking so long I think I'm starting to get a little bit frustrated with like that uh they're not fully putting out like the claims because I don't want this claim to go beyond anything else that is not supposed to be like if the claim is just like a straight out and we shall like that and then we'll get the payment set up but it seems to me that they are delaying. So I don't know it's it's been since April I don't think you should take that long like it's almost the end of the year now. Yeah I understand. So this is for the here in one case is it mister the one where your car was parked there and it was a hit and run, was it that one for this car that's one that's me claiming against the energy went off and then we have, I have a witness will have the number, the number of people like the investigation obviously isn't following up with me for anything, so I don't know what's going on here. Okay. Yeah so usually when you're making a claim against the other party for the case, right? Is your workshop that is doing the claim on your behalf? So for that case you would need to follow up with your work. So you need to tell them, hey, what happened to my case? Are you guys coming from the insurance? Okay? As for the other accident which I'm looking at right now, if you just hold on for me, I'm waiting for the patient. It's the one is it? I believe it's the Earth Street open when the third party of two clothes and collided. Oh no, yeah. Okay. Let me have a look. Mhm. This is the one on two April 2021, one hmm. Inquiry to we have I hated liability inform. Oh wow there's a lot of updates for this one. Hold on what I need to check. Just give me a moment please and sure I need to I need to have clarity, especially for that case because they they sent out an email on that and I've been waiting on to to settle on everything but they they're not they're not getting back on me at all. I see. I'm sorry to hear that. Just give me a moment. Let me have a quick look at the policy type mm mm There's a lot notes on this one. I'll tell you what, allow me to get the claim officer to give you a call back because there really is a lot of uh to and fro and a lot of this for this case uh by looking at the summary of the case, I am really unable to a certain what's the next step or what is the current situation for this claim case? I need to get the I've just got in, I mean like I think a couple of months back um I received an email uh informing that this could be turning into uh personal claim because um the insurance doesn't cover whatever it has happened whatsoever. So I'm like sure, fair enough but I'm just waiting for them to follow up with um like a proper black and white personal came but isn't coming on at all. So I don't want like like you know if any um like extra assessments with me to the car uh with regards to the damages that I did not like cause however it's supposed to be because it's it was, I mean like humidity the lady was at fault by following by the rules and regulations according to the officer investigation officer, like whoever is parking this also like yeah there's a lot of like you said, so I'm just waiting for that to uh be forward to me so I can certainly once cause I wanna close this case and I want to let go the insurance once is that I see? Okay so if you say that you have uh an officer to follow the case with me then that's fine because I'm sorry ma'am I gotta be off for work now so Okay so uh we'll get my claim officer to call you directly instead of your mom is so we'll call this contact number confirming as per the one called in is 9204991. So uh required from the claim officer, is there any is there any way I can get him to call me on my order number, Which number do you prefer us to call you on If I'm gonna be providing you one now (915) 212 76 91 five. Uh huh 212 212 7676. Let me repeat that 91521276. Yes correct. Okay um So the thing that is required from our end to concern if can slim from the policy cash because from my notes I noticed previously right, this one um happened because the previous policy before the renewal, it was actually for a let me see the one that is previously, yep it's a classic plan, yep, the classic plan that was without the anyone to drive your car, right? So this part I can see from the case claim and I noticed that after that the action chicken home inform we have appreciated liability, submit survey report on on the basis on repudiated liability liability, which means that the claim officer confirming that we cannot uh cover for it. Okay. Yeah. Yeah, correct. I noticed she did send one to you as well. Uh let me no claim requested them to some meal survey report team. Okay. So let me retrieve that from my system. If I could see. So at least I know what I really I'm really sorry, but I've got to be right now, so uh yeah, if there's any then just maybe get him to call me on the number one I've given you earlier. Okay. Okay. Just trying to make a call to the number that was uh I'm more active on the second number. That's why I see. I'll give the number. I asked him to try the one that you've given to me first. So basically what you get from them on this case is whether if there's anyone I want to get it then Yeah, this one. Okay. Okay. Can I will get them and then thank you so much. Thank you.

Um There's been a bit of a change in the travel so is it okay to cancel the travel insurance and then repurchase it. Uh Yeah you can either do that or can depending on how what is the gravity of the change? Is it moved to a much later date or something? Um It's been extended extended? Oh so you mean the policy already started? Can I maybe I'll give you the insurance policy? Sure go ahead. I see your policy number can Okay I see it S 7301963 Z.

Okay and how many people are insured inside the policy? 2, 2 people. Yeah. Alright and lastly your email address please Caitlyn pong at gmail dot com. Alright thank you. So okay looking at the insured, I found a matching insurance policy so indeed 26 to 8 so you mean instead of uh until eighth uh it needs to be extended to uh much I'm actually leaving leaving past midnight on the 27th now change of flight uh So there is a need to move move and um let me see Red returning on on the 10th I think. Let me take a look. Uh Okay then uh yeah if there is a change of uh uh flight details or itinerary Yeah you can uh I mean to make it much cleaner instead of because we can also raise a request for endorsement but it may be quite confusing because there will be an moving of start date as well as an extension, right? Because from the original trip duration of 13 days. So maybe it would be better to just uh by the replacement policy with a new your new travel uh details. And then uh you can uh cancel the the the first one you bought since it hasn't started yet, you can get full refund for the premium and uh of course subject to no claims. You're not submitting any claims against the policy has been traveled. Yeah yeah because uh for uh yeah you just need to highlight that uh it's subject to no claims and uh it cannot be reinstated in in case you change your mind and wants to use the policy again. So you can just log in uh to cancel that right after you we would suggest you buy the replacement policy first so that you can just be sure that you have the insurance in place and then you can log into your online account. Did you activate it before Caitlyn? No. Oh you did not let me just double check. Oh you did actually, you did, you did uh you did and then on the online account is tagged to the your I see.

       " {'transcript': \"I'm speaking, how may I assist you? Hi sorry who's that? Uh My name is pam P. A. M. Hi, my name is okay, how can I assist you? I have a um I received emails for some change of policy with W. D. Can you help me track if it has updated it correctly for the coveted coverage as well coverage. Okay. Alright so for this answer in order for me to pull out the record in our system, can I know sir, which policy do you have with FW D. Uh travel travel insurance? Okay, do you have the okay let me just uh pull out the person sir uh for the travel insurance sir, when is the travel date that you have provided? It's 18th December 2021 November 18 December December December. So for this uh the contact number sir that you have provided uh during the time that you have purchased, is it the same contact number? Yeah. 97281882 9728 1882. Okay hold on let me just pull out the record in our system for a moment. Okay and just to do a simple verification with you can I have your contact I mean your date of birth? Uh 23rd july 1975. Okay and how about the last four characters of your 2398 and lastly sir, what is the coverage that you have selected the travel region outside of us outside of us? Okay, thank you very much. So for this one sir you have purchased a new policy is it can you hold on Because upon checking so you have this COVID-19 coverage. And what is the changes that you have done on your policy? See originally I purchased a single policy I looked up and they said you can only buy covered for single travel policy. So I went and bought a single travel policy first. Now I put in a start date of 18 december. I thought the single travel is like a normal one month. I did not put any end date. Anyway, I made the payment, it was very small payment of something like $32 or something for maybe it was just one day, right? And I did not know it was only for one day, but anyway I did that policy and then I added on a covered policy for which I think I paid another $88. Okay, so it also attached to the same policy for one day, probably that once it was done after that I realized that it's actually ending on the same day it starts. But my travel plans in Europe extended second or third of january. Okay. Alright. And so I went in 19th of november, I made the changes to extend the single policy to go from you know, 18 december till third of january asked me to pay 1 $15 more. I made the payment to pay, it did not recognize anything, it did not update any statements, just five minutes back, I received an email from wd that finally it has been updated, although if I go to the website and put in my login id as of now it is not showing any updates to my policy, but if I download the policy document of 8898 policy number, it is showing that my travel policy has been updated to but that's the main policy for which I paid $152 extra. Now the add on was with for Covid now is the add on for Covid valid for the same period as a travel, so I don't have to pay any extra or do I have to pay extra for covered? Also that's my question. Okay, Alright so for this because we have notified you that we have already received your payment, so upon checking the coverage that we have here, firstly that the check first when it comes to your travel insurance, at least we can check it one by one. Okay, Alright so for this upon checking the travel insurance that you have with us with the policy number ending with 898 okay, the coverage period that I have here sir is december 18th 2021 until january 3 2022 which is correct. Right, alright and then let us check right now when it comes to your travel insurance to make sure that everything is okay. Okay, can you check if the coveted covet is also for the same period because I did buy the add on Covid policy, right, that's what we need to check now. Alright sure sure hold on. Alright so upon checking for this one sir, the policy coverage for the travel insurance with the COVID-19, this one is actually ending with the same date of the start date, which is November 18, 2021. Okay how do I change this? Do I have to go onto the internet to make the changes? Can I change this? Okay, can you try to log in sir on our W D. S. G. F. So the same thing that you have done with your travel insurance, if you can also extend the policy until the third of january, so while I'm on the line we can also if it will be successful or not, but do I have to pay extra for this again correct? Because I paid I've paid a lot of money already. Yeah because for this one the coverage for your policy is only for one day and then uh of course automatically our system will also generate a premium. If let's say for example we are going to extend the trip duration from December 18 to to january of course that would be a different premium. Your website doesn't even work properly, I'm trying to sign in on the website, it doesn't let me sign it, have you tried using the or the using the app is not working properly? Okay, pretty bad. Okay now I'm on the website going in Okay yes on the website even for the single first policy number 898 ending in 898, it is still showing me the expiry date is 18 december 2021. It has seems like your I. T. Team has not updated actually it is updated already, it's just that since that is the original policy that will be recorded. Right, but you may refer to the email that you have sent you where you can actually download the updated policy sir because that is an endorsement policy already that's why we send you a separate email for that, but it would show me the old date only at the beginning for the for the new email sir that we have sent you right yesterday I believe that one will be an updated period of insurance already. Okay, it's asking me for money and when I click on the website it doesn't let me select that. Why is that okay, is there any other like is there any like pay now grab pay these three options, I click on anything it highlights and then disappears, there's nothing that happens, what do I do? Okay for the for the option of credit card, you cannot also uh select that correct? Yeah it it says first would you like to save your card for future purchase if I say no it takes me to another page. Okay, no matter what I say if I click it's not letting me pay? Okay well what if I cancel all my policies and buy a new one, why don't I do that? Also can also sir, so at least for the one sir, since you have purchased this policy, let me double check. Okay so for this uh 18, since it's still under the feel look right and of course the policy hasn't started yet, so you can actually proceed to cancel the policy and you can purchase a new one with the correct period of insurance er to make it easier, so you're fine. Okay it will take five working days. Do I have to chase uh for that one sir? If let's say for example uh it will be refunded back to the same uh mode of payments or that we use so we didn't find that and working conditions. So I use I think now can you check how did I pay for this? Which one sir for this uh current policy has anything for anything I'm currently checking, can you hold on? Okay so upon checking sir, the payment that you use? Right, it's uh P announcer all the time. Yes correct. Okay now I'm going to, so I requested for a cancellation, does it show in your system so far it doesn't let me double check for you sir? Okay so for the travel insurance and for the coveted travel insurance, it is canceled already it is already reflected in our system, it is correct. Okay so aside from this, is there anything else that I can assist you with? So when when do I get the money back for this one? Since you have used the piano? Right, it will be credited back within 5-5 to 10 business days. 5-10 business, is is there any faster way I'm sorry again sir? Okay so it's asking me again for the same thing $201 to pay upgrade so I being Okay get covered for COVID-19 108.55 up to 30 days before your trip during etcetera etcetera, add cover. Okay I'm adding that cover, let's continue nothing else Next my details, can you just be with me for another one minute? Sure, no problem sir. Okay, Okay asking me for the entire policy about $310 single trip insurance for family of twitter's and two Children traveling worldwide, excluding us in december 3rd january covered proceed to pay. Okay now sorry the service available right now mm Mhm what do I do? Baby the bank so it's not letting me if I need to use the scan right there is another way to do it, is there no number? Okay um for the support mobile banking app that supports scan the Q. R. Code, it's not scanning somehow. Oh is there any other options? Uh no is there any other other options for you to do the payment number number? This normally works? I don't know why it's not working. Okay man, you cannot be okay tend to R A P Y. D. Holdings, is that correct? Yes correct sir. The rapid one, is it correct? Oak seems to have gone okay on your website and training. It's processing. Okay, I got some some details. Maybe this thing should work. Okay. Alright, good to hear. So is there anything else that we can assist you with? No thanks very much. No problem. Thank you very much. And have a nice day. Thank you.

Okay so I do a cancellation online and then purchase a separate one for each of the members ma'am if the refund upset upset refund in terms of the refund miss you. Oh it will be processed back to the same card that you have used to buy the policy. If it feels then automatically will issue a refund via check so it's a separate transaction number policy.

Uh I got another quote actually from another insurance, there's a better quote and I saw from the policy that is I have the right to cancel it within seven days there is after the policy is that that policy we can consider policy for you but there will be a fee involved, the policy started so my policy is applied so we can cancel the policy for you but uh there will be a fee involved, so the balance will be refunded back to you. How much is that again? 5 3.50 5 3.50. Um I see I think I'm trying to because I tried to apply the cancellation from the website.

The uh the default or the the one we are advising is to cancel it via the customer portal guess and as I can see from here his I. C. Number uh your dad's I. C. Number is showing us activated so meaning uh he can if he has the mobile app or if you can go to the F wt website when he logged in, there's an option to cancel the manage policy and then cancel the policy password twice. Um there's an option there to retrieve password. Uh It's just that you have to make sure you are entering the correct uh full I see an email address okay to be able to reset the password successfully. So uh can I confirm that also the mobile number, is it the 97934472, is that his mobile? Yes, yes it will be sent to him, that's why you can do it later once because anyway he's the only one who can cancel or must request for cancellation of the policy so as long as uh he's already available you can also choose the date there of the effective date of cancellation. Okay. Uh and then uh you will instantaneously you should be receiving a uh like it will show on the screen also on the any refund amount eligible for canceling the policy early. Okay. Uh that one is subject to no claims and subject to 80% of the unused period, minimum of $26.75. Yeah. Okay. Alright. And then later if uh any issue with the online cancellation and all that? Okay. Uh Alternatively you can ask your uh that to send over a copy of the uh the registration letter from LTA. Okay. And then attach a copy of that and then uh on the email and then send it over to us then we will forward to another team for processing. Alright. Yeah. Okay so you you you just ask him to try first the online because that one is faster because if it's through us, we also need to forward to another team first then you have to wait for three working days and all that. Okay. Alright. Is that all for today or anything else? I can help check that's all Okay. Have an awesome day to you stay safe, take care. Okay. One second this is chrisy. Goodbye. Bye bye.\"},\n",

So what's your policy number? Okay I I have two policy number, one of it is P. N. T. Okay P. E. N. T. C. C. P. N. T. C. 2021-00002334. Uh four zeroes. Right 40. Okay. Alright one will do for now.

Uh sorry is it 2234 or 2334 Me too. 2334 2334 And there are four Zeros on there. Yes. Okay sure thank you for let me see here. So uh what what are the what's the nature of your enquiry first. Okay so I would like to take actually when you purchase this inquiry Germany but because of recent issue right? Uh we will be changing destination and one of the person in this policy will no longer be going for the trip. So I would like to do, I'm checking it, can we cancel in person and then change destination or must we cancel the policy and again? Oh okay alright uh actually let me check on the policy details first before I advise you, okay on the best way to uh to take. Okay may I know what is the how many people in total actually Uh for your insurance for this insurance? For 5, 5 people? Yeah. And the travel dates please? 15, 15 5th december to 15 december. Uh Okay and alright you said just now uh Okay. Uh What about the email address you have registered please? Uh Fadela underscore at yahoo dot com. Thank you. And last four characters of your. I see. Okay, so you're also one of the insured? Right? So meaning you're one of them. Okay. Alright so I see here the rest of the insured. Okay so since the policy is uh Okay only by 5th december. Okay because of the changes, right, there are two changes you you need. Okay and it cannot be a removal of the insured may not be possible to uh as a valid amendments on the insurance. So um but I mean the Germany wise it's where are you going now? I mean what's the new destination? It still falls under the same category. So actually no need to change change region because the region you have chosen before is because we we doesn't go by country, it's by region. So your chosen region is world excluding uh usa so as long as you're not going to us, any part of the U. S. Or transiting there then no need to change actually. But because of the but the because of the removal of one person, right? Uh I it would be best to actually buy an entirely new policy with the intended insured so that it will be uh Yeah. And then uh anyway it's only by is there any change on the dates also because one of the person, I mean she's not well so we decided because now you know, understand the change and destination destination, I understand, I completely understand that. So uh yeah, so that would be a better way to go since it's uh it's still uh quite a long, I mean a lot of weeks to go before the cancellation of the policy. Okay. For cancellation wise, did you uh the easiest and most convenient way? Uh fastest way is through the online portal. Have you activated your online account? Uh No, I did not know what to do by the phone for over the phone, is it actually I don't have the authority to do cancellation. We can only forward it to the policy servicing team. So that's why uh if if you want that option it's okay I can forward it to the policy servicing team but uh it will take longer than 2 to 3 working days for you to receive a confirmation that it's processing. Yeah, so that's the one of the difference. So if you want urgent or immediate cancellation uh we advise that because there's like a cancel button when you log into the online account and you can see already the confirmation email that it's been canceled should be uh should be within the next 5 to 10 minutes after you click on the so I customer portal, I sign up for the I sign up on my own is actually no, we already said we should have already sent you the activation email, uh by the way, when did you, when was this the email?

Uh uh Hi good afternoon because I'm calling uh regarding my uh car insurance that bought earlier this year because I've been buying duty for the previous two years or so. So this year will be the third year. So I realized that the coverage is wrong because just now I tried to renew my my uh my text right then insufficient thinking how come so I realized that uh this is earlier by a month. Okay uh let me just check your policy 1st may I get your vehicle number S I have Singapore London film. Yes correct. 2748 2748 P. T. For Thailand I know peaceful. Uh Yes correct. Uh let me check.

Yeah Sean okay let me just check for you give me a moment. Sure so currently your policy expiry date is 21st of january 2022 for you to be able to renew your text for six months period, you need to have the policy until 21st of february 2022. Yeah correct so it's about one month so uh what you can do is to extend the policy um because we can no longer change the date but what you can do is to extend the policy until 21st of february, 2022 how you can do that is actually via the customer portal via D F W D S G F. Okay. Under manage policy, there's an extension uh extended ended. Okay. So meaning uh using the app, is it uh that's correct using the app or the customer portal from the website Customer? Okay, let me recall your login. If you cannot remember your login, right, or you can click on uh retrieve password, they will ask for your full email address and you just click submit and then reset your password? Okay, sure. Alright. Alright. You're welcome. Is there anything else in the meantime I can assist you? Oh okay. No, no, so so sorry the other thing would be because uh my previous two other policies, we always have been on the february, so that means this time, I mean something was wrong meaning correct could mean that you selected the start date wrongly s 22nd of january I believe because you purchased it on the top of january meaning on the same month. Okay. Okay. Okay, so then that that can be okay. Got it, got it extend, sorry, sorry then we extend right then how do they calculate the extended month? Uh it's based on the premium that you paid, so depending on how many number of days extended. Yeah, so based on the number would be extension immediate. Okay, so once you extend? Right, yes it's immediate, it's just that um, you will receive the device policy via email. We will then transmit the information to them if you pay today because today is a friday. Uh, it's nearly six p.m. So we will only transmit on Monday so you can try to renew the road from Monday on what? Okay. Great. Okay. Thank you. All right. You're welcome. Thank you so much.

Um I took out an insurance, a travel insurance policy and no matter which way I try and log in or retrieve or anything, it doesn't let me um get into it during uh with the app, I've got an email um and I've got a policy number but we've also cancelled our trip and moved it to the summer.

Oh but how is that your number or you have used number instead of the let me check. Oh did I book this before? No I booked this after I got my sin. I've changed the pr but I'm sure I booked it with my pr number and not my old thin but I can give you that it's um my old phone number was uh 215 T. Okay, thank you. And how about the last four characters I am in the date of birth, sorry, sorry, 21 June at three. Uh What date sorry? 21 June 1983. 21st January 1983. Can you hold on for a moment?

Family type of insurance. The actually said the details that we have here is still your phone number and also for your date of birth, it is also incorrect. Okay well that's been wrong. 21st 1993. Yeah, because the one we have in our system is 1313 Is what the 13 June 13, 1983. Maybe when you purchased the policy sir, when you have entered the details you've entered it wrong. D but don't worry for this one regarding the policy sir, your travel dates will change right? Yeah, so we want to change the original. The problem is I originally booked an annual policy and then I was told the annual doesn't include the cover cover so I need to book a single trip, so I canceled the annual cover and booked a single trip. And then now we've had to cancel the trip and so we've we've moved the flights to june july next year. So what it's a longer period so it'll be more expensive but I would ideally like to change the dates and just pay to um and I'm I'm well and then also I've booked a trip in March as well so um I don't know whether I go to an annual one but if I could just change the dates and pay the difference. That would probably be the easiest way forward. Oh because uh for this one it's quite very long. One moment.

Right, why? Uh the policy document? Yes, that is the welcome email. Uh you did not receive no. And then the second one is for me to enable to use the correct Okay, this is actually on the same email Yeah, it's actually on the same email but before you can access that there is a separate email sir, that we have sent you to activate now. No worries. Let me forward, let me retrieve the email now so that I can forward that you this one here is another issue portion where I can enter my number and then the day of year just the year, year of birth? Yes correct. Yes correct. Yeah, I download pdf but it keeps saying error, I can't I can't open it, do you have access to it now and then I guide you on how to open may I confirm? Okay, just want to confirm sir, when you enter the password for the pdf file, did you use the password open open? Okay. Uh my my wife managed to send me the email because oh okay, I can change for the second email, can you send it to me? Yes sir, I'm actually in the process of retrieving it now I'll forward you the online activation email in a bit. Okay so for this particular one, once you manage to activate, Okay by the way when you receive the email, it will ask you to enter a password. So since this is your first time you can create your own password. Uh it must be a minimum of eight digits and then a combination of capital and small letters and a number. Okay. Yes. Uh simple also can include as well so when you uh once you have created sir you can log into your online account. Okay, this one even you can just go directly to the fW D uh websites or there is a log in button and then from there there was uh once you managed to log in, you can actually click under manage policies and then uh you can submit the request to update the date of birth only. Okay, so there's an option for you to do that, but at least whenever you need to access your documents, manage your policy would be able to do it uh once you have activated the account sir, so I'm going to forward you the email uh in at least five minutes, so you should be able to receive it now so that would be great aside from this area. So by the way once you manage to activate online, okay, uh usually within one or two working days you will receive a revised certificate that will reflect your correct date of birth. Okay. Okay okay can I ask you about something about this personal accident policy brief information is normally like my wife and my daughter, my daughter, she fell claim medical fee or Okay let me check accident accident yes. For accidents or uh you're under your plan. Okay. Uh your wife actually purchased the 500,000 plan. Okay so for yourself, Okay uh in terms of medical inpatient or outpatient expenses because of an accident you're covered up to $10,000 for the child is half of the benefit, it's up to $5,000 for inpatient and outpatient expenses because of an accident. And then uh this one aside from accident, the policy also includes a coverage for uh infectious diseases. Okay uh but there is a waiting period of 90 days. Okay so if let's say for example there is a medical expenses incurred because of an infectious disease, like maybe a Covid 19 I have to go for inpatient or outpatient treatment then this benefit is entitled to 50% of the benefit you are claiming for. So if let's say for adult that because of covid 19 medical treatment, then the 10,000 it will be uh to 50% so 50% of 5000 coverage for yourself for infectious diseases for the child, it's 2500 coverage for infectious diseases. So by the way um I've already forwarded the email to you sir, would you like to check if I stay on the line for us? Sure. Sure, sure, no worries. Thank you. That's awesome. So from there sir, just have to click on the link to activate it and then as soon as possible sir, please submit your request to actually update the from the inside, by the way. Just to share with you as well. Mr ALF in for the Covid 19. The infectious disease coverage I mentioned to you other infectious disease there is a waiting period of 90 days but Covid 19 we cut down the waiting period to 15 days, so it's much harder for the coverage I'm just curious about aside from this, is there anything else I can help you with? Okay, thank you so much for giving us a call and you have a good day ahead. Thank you. Once again, my name is Irish bye bye.\"},\n",

       " {'transcript': \"wd good afternoon, this is speaking, how may I assist you? Hi, good afternoon, I recently bought travel insurance policy from FW D. But I just wanted to um check whether did I get the coverage uh because I realized that the coverage is an add on? Right. Yeah, so can you help me check if um that writer was added into my policy because I think I was rushing through, so I'm not sure if I if I edited on can I have your name sir? You are uh my name is Mr Jeffers, could I confirm your full name and date of birth? Uh Mama Jeff have been up to lock 30th April 1990. And just to confirm is the start and end of your trip. My start date is 29 November, my end I believe is seven January. Okay so from what I could see for your current travel insurance from five August until sorry bear with me that's not coming from the 29th november until the seventh of january 2022, it actually exceeded the 40 day period as such, we are not able to add on and cover for the Covid 19 coverage. It will not cover for any Covid 19 related uh situation so I can recommend is that is to log into your online account to process the cancellation, full refund for your policy. Bear with me while I check if your account was activated to process the cancellation. Alright yep Once I cancel the policy I can book um the full refund will be back to the same card, useful payment, I would recommend you check with other insurance company because your trip is more than 30 days and for the COVID-19 writer to be added in it has to be 30 days and below. Oh okay why why Because our underwriters and actually as far as management has looked into it and that's where um they have come to the conclusion that 30 days is the maximum we can cover for COVID-19-related trips, and travel it may be revised um in the future but as of now it still Spence So okay so what happens if I were to adjust at in the COVID-19 for 30 days of the of the policy uh it will be considered invalid because even if you are just the dates for example you declare 10 days lesser instead of seven january, maybe you put about 27 of December, therefore the two days of the trip, right? Um but the date you return is seven of January, it will avoid the whole contract because the end date is not accurate as per your boarding class so we will not be covering it. Okay so the coveted 19 coverage is uh specific to um if I get coveted overseas or once I if I get it if I'm back is it is is that how that works Um how it works, is that if your trip is less than 30 days and your diagnosis, COVID-19 in Singapore itself, you can submit a claim for cancellation if you're diagnosed overseas. Oh here I'm sorry, overseas if you're diagnosed overseas will cover $400 300,000 Singapore dollars medical expenses uh for your medical expenses incurred overseas as well as when you come back to Singapore, It's 100,000 Singapore medical expenses coverage. Alright, But having said yeah, go ahead, go ahead. I would recommend that you check other insurance company because I think they are this will cover up to 50 days or 40 days for the travel. So it's just follow FWT specifically currently we only cover 30 days. Okay, okay, so that means the current policy I have with you guys for the travel insurance only covers it covers my entire trip without the benefit. Right? Yes. Okay. And which means uh if let's say if I were to get medical assistance overseas, you still will cover me, but as long as I believe is that what you're saying? Yes, that's correct. Mr jeffers, but having said that it's best for you to check with uh travel insurance because it's not just the medical expenses that could occurred, you say for example you are diagnosed touch with if I'm diagnosed with Covid 19 in Singapore, I will have to cancel my trip all together, which means the hotel, the flight activities you pay for, you need to send me for that. So usually for travel insurance it does cover for that, it's just the four hours in particular, we don't have the coveted portion of it for this travel. Yeah, so I would still recommend that you check with other insurance company, you still have time um as long as you activate your account, which I'm gonna get you how to do so now because I notice you haven't activated yet Just bear with me on that and then later on you can log in in your in your convenience as per your convenience to cancel the policy if you manage to get a travel insurance with other insurance company that covers for your 14 day trip. All right, okay and um I noticed that when I booked this policy online, there wasn't any alert to tell me that yeah, so that that is not on my end, right? Because I think if that was then I would have seen it, but I think my payment went through and everything went through, it's just that when I wanted to print out because I'm traveling with my wife and she had a lesser than 30 days. So that's why she got to like documents to print. We had one, that's correct because um for this one right in relation to that, uh the page actually has the part this is this does not include Covid 19, but that's not in the main page is actually on the second page when you generate the code, This is the COVID-19 outbreak, considered a non event and when you for example got the trip, which is more than 30 days, there will be no an option available for you to click on to top up for so I think that's what happened for this policy Yeah. Okay, so what I'll do for you, I'll get you how to activate your account uh if you have time and in front of your pc can we do it together just to make sure you are able to activate it with our areas? Yeah, sure. I'm at your website right now, let me see first policy was purchased recently Okay, let me check, yeah, and can I verify your email address as well at Hotmail dot com. Okay, I'm checking for the activation email, Let me see when was this purchase? This was purchased nine of November this couple of days ago there we go, I need to put you on hold because I'm looking for your activation email. Alright, just a short moment thank you. You are on hold, you are on hold, you are on hold, you are on hold, thank you for holding. So sorry to put you on hold okay um forward the activation email to your email address. Mr java, could you kindly check if you receive any email from me, it will be sent from contact SG yes, that's the one as your corporate contact and if you can just scroll down to the um email that says customer portal Manager policy of East. There is underlying here, which is orange in color. You need to click on that uh Sure it's under my signature. Where do I find it again? The signature if you see stay safe and healthy. Always wishing you awesome. We go ahead, that's my signature. Right. If you scroll below uh there will be another email there. Uh Yeah. Okay. So if you see the orange color here that's underlying there, just click on that and you should be diverted to our website to set up a password you can remember. Uh Yes, I'm so just set up your password, but then it's just a normal like a website that I would go in. Yes, it looks like that, but you need to set up the password first by setting up the password, you're activating your online account. So that later on when you want to cancel your policy or you want to check your policy or submit a claim, you can log in to the FW online account or the FWD mobile app. Okay. Uh am I supposed to see uh a problem that um and password or something like that, uh once you get, it will be activated here. New password, confirm, password? Oh no, I don't see that. Okay, so what I see in your signature, right is your name and then the stuff and then there's a there's like a picture that tells me purchase a manager policy through FWD and then below that I see, email us your contact number and call me back, I don't see uh the okay you found it. Alright awesome, awesome. Okay so I just have to type password right? Mhm. Just give me a second, no worries, take your time. Okay so I received a P. Okay let me put that in. Okay. Yeah so um so I click on my policy under my policy, you will see your travel insurance there. So when you're ready to cancel it, for example if you manage to find Other insurance company that covers for the full 40 day trip. And they also include COVID-19 benefits as well. You can actually click on manage policy Okay and then cancel so once you click cancel, right, the process is immediate, you will get a pop up to say uh filling the reason of cancellation, like not traveling anymore. Um found better coverage elsewhere. Example and then uh if as long as the policy has not started yet and you have requested for cancellation, The process will be immediate usually within like five minutes or so you will receive a cancellation confirmation email to say that this policy has been cancelled, refunded back to the same card, useful payment and pretty much uh we believe that the amount should show on the same day in your card details how we cancel uh things that we buy online, the credit amount immediately back to our car, it should be so unless of course your bank will take a bit longer to process such refund request. Alright okay and you're saying that um if I were to cancel this before the policy starts, which means that until the 28th of november 28th of november to actually do so if you want to be sure because um sometimes customer have issues logging in and things started and 28 is actually a Sunday if you call us uh you might not be able to come through to us because we don't work on sunday, I would recommend just to make sure everything is fine. Try to do the cancellation on friday which is 26 we are here nine in the morning until 10 in the evening. If you have issues logging in, we can still put in a request from outside but it will take two working days to process. That's all Okay I understand. Uh Can I also clarify that the coveted um Writer right is mandatory only for those with any of the vitale flight? Uh We believe it's best to have because it's not just a matter of going on V. T. L. Flights even if it's not a V. T L. Uh country right? We still cover there's more in the event touch wood if the insured is tested positive for Covid 19 right so that's the reason for in mm Okay Okay um Alright okay yeah sure thank you so much.

       " {'transcript': \"good afternoon speaking, how may I help you on how to make a claim on my students personal accident? Okay, let me uh assist you on that ma'am. May I just have your uh details first? I can check for you. Thank you. Okay what's your I see your policy number ma'am. Uh my number is S. 7400531. D. For Denmark 531. Okay how may I address you Just you can just call me Pc or miss. Thank you. All right thank you. Miss lee one moment. Personal accident. Okay. How many people are insured inside your personal accident policy myself? On yourself And your uh email address is pola at uh Hotmail dot com. Thank you. What about your uh do you remember your sum assured for your personal accident? I think it's 100 K. 100 K. Okay thank you so much. I found your matching policy. So uh you mentioned you need to submit a claim, is it uh like a medical for outpatient medical expense? Yeah that's right. Because what happened is i this is my actually my first time uh cleaning after so long uh this last saturday this last day I have a fall and actually my my arms and my hands. I'm sorry to hear that. Thank you very much. That's why I went to a polyclinic because I have a follow when I went to uh you can get everything close. I need to go on a Tuesday. Tuesday uh Tuesday to do extra, so Tuesday I went to do X ray. Uh luckily quite quite quite likely they say there's no factor or anything good. Yeah but the issue is uh I'm still suffering from pain and and and and selling. So I am thinking of going for a second opinion which is uh which is going for another doctor, which is the appointment for tomorrow. This whole thing works and get all the amount and claim or what what am I supposed to do? Alright, submission of claim wise Miss lee it's uh you can submission, the window period is within 30 days from incurring the charge or from the actual accident date so you can uh you can do so you can send the submit the claim first for the initial visits and all that. Uh And then if you have any like follow ups or related outpatient visits for the same accident, you can just submit it later as a follow up claim related to the same accident. So you can just register the claim first for now uh for the one that you finish already, you already have the receipt right? You already paid for the then you can submit it online directly. Uh I'm just checking if you have activated, do you remember logging in before miss lee because I want to because I didn't know that I I just need to have 1% accident but I have 2% accident, different companies I see I just wanted to check whether do I have mm Okay yes so uh since you can log in uh there is when when you see the policy uh reference there, right, there's a submit a claim option so you can just click on that and then uh it will you just fill in the fields required, required and then there would be a recall upload documents section uh and then you can just submit so once that is completed you will also receive on a confirmation email with the claim reference number. So that means your claim already registered and they will uh process it within normally 14 days or uh to a month, depending on the complexity of the claim, could I just show you what what what what documents do I need to to do something other than my receipt to a letter from the doctor indicating that has informed him that came and it was really because of my accident mm Yes uh because if it's not uh normally it's not on the receipt, right? So uh I mean if you do have the any medical related document, I suggest you just submit them altogether but uh later on uh I mean the the main thing is the receipt. Okay but if the claim's officer deems it necessary uh during their processing right to uh to update additional information or clarification on what that receipt is for then they will uh inform you separately with the claim reference also. Yeah but but I would suggest whatever you have for now you just submit together and then uh let's just see how it goes when the processing the claims processing officer uh Yeah checks the documents you have submitted and the details, would you be okay if I left my apartment with another doctor's uh can I just go to that then after that I submit together? Like maybe tomorrow after Oh yeah, it's up to you, as long as as mentioned within 30 days from the incurring the charge, uh you submit and also to avoid to avoid losing the, you know the receipt and all that. So yeah it's but it's up to you if you want to do it tomorrow also can since it's still within the timeframe. Okay that'll be maybe just once but at least you know you know how to go about it already. Thank you. Thank you appreciate your assistance. Thank you very much. Not a problem is leave right now, is there anything else I can check for you? Uh that's why that's why I just wanted to know how this whole power has been so many years but that's something also right. But that's something that means you're not usually having accidents. So feel I hope you are the injury is uh you know, the pain will go away very soon so that you can be 100% again. Thank you very much appreciate that. No worries. Okay. Anyway if anything you just uh call us again, contact us again, we'll be happy to assist you. Okay? Thank you very much. You. Thank you. Bye. Take care, stay safe. Okay. Once again, this is Christy.

       " {'transcript': \"Good afternoon speaking, how may I help you? Hi this is Alexis um I'm calling with regards to a travel related claim, the website and the app is both down. Oh uh so you mean you cannot proceed with the purchase of it uh the claim so uh once I click on submit it will say error and it's the same on the app as well as on the website. Oh okay sorry about that. Uh Okay let let me pull up your details first and then I will advise you on maybe an uh the alternative way to submit the claim since this is uh there's an ongoing issue. Can I have your I see your policy number please ma'am uh my which one policy or I see either one uh so that I can pull up your records. Yeah. Okay. Uh maybe the policy is T. N. T. R. Okay 2021 Alright zero 6464 6464. Thank you, how may I address you ma'am Alexis, Alexis, Alexis. Uh But I mean for the on the policy, how what's your full name indicated? Alexis, Strong India. Okay thank you Alexis. Uh Let me see policy. Alright so how many people are insured inside this policy please? 1 1, okay and the travel period uh is six November to I think 13 or 14 November. I remember how about your email address, Alexis J. At gmail dot com? Alright thank you so much. Alright I found the matching policy, let me just see any reports regarding claim so you tried via the app and the online version but it's the same same, exactly the same area. The submit button after you click, it doesn't go through the next the confirmation page, is that right? Um after I click submit, there will be a pop up that says that there's an error, I can take a screenshot of the app but on the website and there is some api issue yeah the api expired mm. Okay. Alright. Uh Alexis is it okay if uh are you still on the website right now on the in front of a P. C. No but I can be okay yeah because the two other options left would be to submit through the online form without logging in uh because the bug is uh I checked the report and there was a bug reported already for the online access meaning after you log in that particular button indeed is causing some issues or yeah so it's still being fixed by our I. T. Team but the online uh web form uh that's the part where you can just key in first the details, the policy number and your your personal information and then you can upload also the documents from there. Uh Yeah yes can so you just need to go to online right so instead of signing in, you go under claims and then uh there will be uh two options there so click on the don't have an account, click here to get started, yep, yep and then click travel. Mhm. Yes and then click uh which which one you're claiming from under the main travel or the under covet 19. Alright and then uh I'm on this page now but then actually under the policy number um it says P. N. T. R. 20 yep. Then you just continue the 21 21 dash. Oh okay then Okay yes correct. And then uh yes you can just follow the prompts. Okay and then uh this one there's no reported issues with the submit so hopefully it goes through uh uh but maybe I can give you for now I can also give you the last alternative just in case it's uh to email directly to claims team but that one is the last option, last resort because it will take longer for them to register manually, the the claim, so that's that's claims dot S G mm at fwd dot com, mm. Okay. Yeah. Um Yeah and and then I have another related question which is uh for my wallet was actually stolen overseas in Italy. So I came back already I felt a police report in Italy um I've also found a local police report for my I see, so my question is for this travel claim right? Um definitely there was money that was stolen, but there's also I guess my personal belongings which is the wallet and uh the icy and place together token and some credit cards. So with that uh which option can I do multiple claims on the same policy for multiple items. Yes. You can uh you just submit the uh the supporting documents for the items that you're claiming or it would be best if you want to uh to also provide any supplementary, you know, maybe in writing or something like that after you submit the claim and got the claim reference number. Normally they will also review first what you're claiming for uh claiming for based on the, you know, the, the receipts, the police report. Yeah, it will be itemized there anyway. So later on they will uh the claims officer to be assigned to your case will be reaching out Okay. If they need for the clarification or verification, then you can go from Della, there will be a direct correspondence. Direct correspondence with a claims officer. Yeah. And then in let's say in the type of money when you fill in the full sum that I wish to claim or just up to the policy amount that I'm allowed, you can either way is fine. So if it's uh if you can put their the actual amount that has been lost. Okay then you think was lost and then uh later on if they review then they will just pay out is just to let you know that of course, regardless of how much it is, then we'll only pay up to the maximum amount as per that. Okay. Yeah. Um And one last question, I'm not sure whether you know this whether it's under your purview but um let's say I lost my N. R. I. C. And um on a website they say that I have to pay $100 for replacement on the first law, but there was nothing on it about stolen. I see and whether I need to pay for it I've contacted ICA but they have not gotten back because I think right now they are flooded with um all the different issues. So I'm just wondering in the I. C. Replacement cost is that something that can also be claimed? Uh Well because for loss of, I'm not sure if that can be considered because the the I understand that under our policy wording, right, it's just as travel documents, right, passport travel documents but for uh an R. I. C. The personal belongings, personal belongings, uh I would suggest you just send it in together if you if you already have the receipt uh so that they can take that into consideration when processing the claim because outright I cannot advise if it's uh gonna be falling under the category. Yeah. Okay but because the idea is not getting back to me, I I'm not sure whether I should just continue to apply for a replacement and pay for it, so I can get a receipt wait for them. Uh And then I I'm I'm sure whether it might be outside this 14 day period. Um I'm supposed to file the claim so little bit but not necessarily, it's within 30 days. Okay. And uh as long as you have already registered, I would suggest you register whatever uh whatever it is that you are claiming as of now and then the rest can be like a supporting claim or like a related claim already. So as long as you can, as long as you can register your claim first for the within the 30 days period upon your return. Okay. Okay. That's good. Yeah. Okay then uh All clear, I have no more questions. All right. Okay. All right. So you just try no problem. Alexis. So you just try that first and then if uh any issue you can just email directly to the email address just now. Okay. Okay. Thank you. Okay. Alright for now. Anything else, nope. Okay. You take care stay safe and well, Alexis. Bye. You're welcome. Bye.\"},\n",

Okay just to confirm sir, you are actually trying to uh log in using the wife's account, is it? And I tried to use the mobile trying to do it. Online survey also cannot using the wipes uh user name or is it your own? I see. No, my wife under my wife. Okay, can I confirm sir uh what is the user uh what is the error message that you are getting message again so long? Uh Okay. Uh you see that the id of password? Oh okay. I see um if that is the case, may I confirm uh what is the mobile number uh that you are using your wife is using under the policy? If I know my phone number, confirm, may I also ask for the number of the wife? Okay, the last four digits or whole number? The full digits? three Okay. 1.50427 G. For Germany. Okay, thank you. Uh when you try to log in uh Mr 10 Yuki in 427 G. And then your mobile number, correct? Okay, if that is the case if that is the case where it is possible that it's uh because of the password, if just in case you are unable to remember the correct password sir, are you able to click on the retrieve password button? Just it's just below the password, boxer Captain. Yesterday. Okay, whenever we keep the number, the full the full the full ones including including the S. I. Try my wife, I see. Right. Um Yes. Uh huh The owners and then the email address provided an email address. I tried all these three d. Mhm. Yesterday okay now I submit it is yes sir, that's on my own. Yes sir. Okay, so it's uh a new password? Well the new must be must be minimum of eight digits and then a combination of upper and lowercase letters, number and a symbol or a special character. Oh, so many numbers and special characters. Maybe I opened the password possibly yesterday because the exact details of the policy sir, because of P D P. E. I am not able to disclose but I can guide you on how to do the cancellation? Okay, okay, okay. Open up open so once you are inside Mr Tan uh there was already an option for you to submit the cancellation of the policy. So just to share with you Mr 10 for the policy sir, once it's cancelled, uh you will also receive where the policy holder will receive an email notification or confirmation into working days. And this was usually uh we will refund 80% of the unused portion. As long as the premium is not below $26.75. Uh but this uh refund is subject to no claims or no benefits paid out under the policy. So if there is any accident or any type of benefit out then there will be no refund provided. Okay so how do I go to cancer cancel this one? Are you able to find the policy? And then is there a button for manage policies? Oh my policy just hold on. Okay then Okay can I just cancel my policy? Right, yes yes correct Last year of coverage today yesterday correct reason for cancellation I got a uh scratch my car Okay mm Okay name Okay So the 80% refund to go to my bank account or what received on my bank account? Okay this ones are usually it's back to the same debit or credit card used to buy the policy but if it fails then it will be uh sent via check to the policy holder's name. May I confirm Mr Tan, is there any claim or benefits paid under the policy? Anyone? Uh it was there any accident or uh any any claim made under the policy like windscreen accident? Nothing in it, no accident. Uh huh. How about windscreen shirt? The screen? I did change one, change one side. Okay. Um because if there is a windscreen benefit paid out sir, uh there will be no refund under the policy as well if it is canceled, did we 11 time front windscreen sir, it will not affect the N. C. D. But it is a benefit that is speed under the policy. So as per the policy wording sir, the terms and condition if there was any type of benefit or claim that is speed under the policy, then there will be no refund in the event uh the policy is cancelled midway. So most insurances would have this terms and conditions regarding things now to get a new car will be able to change to the new car um for the insurance or it's not transferable to uh to any other vehicles for the new car, a new policy would have to be taken up for yet. Oh thank you very much happy to assist you sir. Once again, my name is Irish. You have a good day ahead. Thanks, happy to help. Thank you. Bye Bye. Bye.\"}]"

Okay and your uh your email address with us is Lemon underscore 12 at live dot com. You all right give me a moment to just check the policy details so let me check um by the way what is your uh mobile number also even 96551074. Okay Alright uh indeed your policy is expiring 29 so now I need to confirm against the one monitoring site. Uh let me see if I think you need to either just extend first or uh extend or renew and then do some extension if you're are you renewing road tax for one year or six months? Six months? Okay all right let me take a look first. Okay let me see six months as per the one monitoring side. Mhm It's showing us yeah, expiring 17 september so if you renew for Six months uh it should be your policy must be valid until March 2022 17. March 2022 should be your policy expiry date so that it will match. Okay, so but uh October November December January February March March, hold on I'm because there's a maximum period for policy extension. So let me check if it's within that oh is it? Okay, give me a moment and let me just count as well. Uh So uh end of october and then november december january february March March 17th. Actually you should be able to uh but you have to choose maybe you chose beyond 17 March did you try uh you try to do on the portal, is it Uh Yes correct correct. Can you uh while I'm on the phone, can I can I can you try again and then choose specifically the new expiry date of 17 March, see if it because it's still within the 180 days. So supposedly it should, I mean it should be accepted, it should be accepted. Sure. No problem. I wait on the line and you're doing it on the website, Right. On the version. Okay ken okay, okay, it says something went wrong, Something went wrong. Uh Okay. Uh When you chose 22nd, March, March 2000 I think did you try earlier on as well? And uh you reached this page also, did you see the same error earlier previously you never tried, I just want to see them but there was no there was no option. Okay, let me just check the back end here. Uh if there was any, uh, you know, because if it's clashing with another attempt attempt to do extension before, uh then it will not allow you, uh, you have to do it on that side. You hold on for a few moments for me while I check on this place. Okay. Thank you. You are on hold. Thanks for waiting. Hello? Okay. I tried to check but there's there's really no, uh, no other requests clashing with it. So by right. It should so uh, no, I think it's a it's a error with the I. T. Error or bug that's affecting this. So Okay. Can you try again one last time? If it really doesn't work, then, uh, I will just request for it to be manually sent to you the payment link to extend your policy. So uh yeah, that one is through email then you will click the link to make payments, and then, uh, you will receive a updated policy document after your payment like that. Yeah. So this one you try first because this one is easier and, uh, faster, able to get her idea. Okay. Good. So I'll just wait on the line while, uh, while you complete, uh, so that just to ensure no no more errors because sometimes I want to do it after my Okay. Also Yeah. No problem. Okay. I see. Okay. The anyway, there's no urgency, right. Because it's only gonna be by, uh, september 17th. So um yeah. No problem. So once I once I extended it, how long does it take for the process? It's almost immediate meaning uh after your payment, right uh because after this choosing the date you will see a payment screen and it will show you the amount supposedly. Okay and then you can straight away make payment within 30 10 to 30 minutes you should receive already the updated policy document and then uh depending on the time of your payment we will transmit to L. T. A. Uh accordingly want to safest would be 1 to 2 working days. So maybe if you do the extension do with three working days before the the line, I mean that's the latest you can do that. So I got time to transmit to L. A. For you first. Okay thank you. Thank you so much. Okay no problem. Okay so for now you don't don't proceed to to the next page so that it wants slash next time when you try again. Okay. Okay. All right. You're welcome.

Okay alright just before you do anything else, just to check with you, do you remember having a claim against your father's motorcycle insurance? Uh someone's claiming against my father?

Okay so uh yeah because in the app you have the option to just download the cover page, you know the summary and then the invoice separate documents because the one I can find from my end is the in the email it's a whole stack, it's like altogether the documents, so uh let me open that hold on email document, it comes with a secure encrypted password. Right, so I wouldn't be able to send that over to them, you know what what other people do is they just because they only need the table of benefits, they just do screenshots of it and then they so that they can include it on the uh file that they need to upload on the M O M site. Yeah, but uh yeah but that's correct you you do have the option because the online from the downloading uh through the app or the portal, right? No need for password that one. So better I'm just letting you know that uh my access right now is only through the email I uh so I need to enter your password first so that I can you just hold on so your password would be Your I see and then you're born 1984. Right, Okay, let me just enter oh I looked through the uh I mean before uploading the summary table summary, one piece cover note to M O M actually had a look at the detail proposal, the entire policy so but there's no mention of my helpless name in the needed as it speeds the period of insurance because in M O M reply the indicated that uh the personal accident insurance is the document that indicates amount cover, which is minimum 60 key period of insurance and the name of the policy holder because it's together one as mentioned just now it's a whole stack right supposedly. Uh so uh the the first page which shows your uh policy holder details and the helper, the helpers details, right? Should really be sent together with the it's like a supplement, I suggest let's send all the documents to uh to M O M. Not only the summary cover note as well as the detail proposal. Uh Yeah the one with the the amount and the benefits are not necessarily the you know the policy were doing the definitions and all that not not necessary. The uh what do you call it? The the those are the only two pages or two uh sections of the policy document that most people will upload and should be fine and accepted by M O M. Oh okay. Alright. Well could you refer to refer supposed to upload? Okay, sure, sure, no problem. Let me sorry because the system is still loading uh hold on you hold on for a few moments for me let me just check this one for you, you are on hold, you are on hold. Thanks for waiting. Hello? Okay okay I was able to check already loaded. Um Okay so on the policy wording it would be on page uh Page seven. Okay because this is including the tax invoice and everything, so let me count first one four K Page 4 & five. Okay. Page point yeah, no problem. Uh Yes there are actually 22 pages so it's the title on top should be quick summary of your benefits. Okay and then uh you will see their security bond, all the other benefits. Right. And then on the second page, uh except here uh personal accident, 60,000 funeral grant liability to third parties. It shows it shows on the second page there's no need for the help of, need to be on the screenshot. Right. Uh no. When you submit you, you submit the first page again, the insurance summary with the details. Yeah. And then uh you can attach the, the pages that we mentioned just now. No worries. Okay.

Yes. Okay. Okay cool. Alright anything else I can do for you uh Okay you mentioned about if there's no claims what if there's a claims against it? Uh Alright let me check for you for this policy specifically. Sure is there are claims right, Let me see something's going on with uh the policy I believe they should be a claim that be mean but unfortunately unfortunately it's not being made to like make no trust black and white because I don't know he's been taking so long like these these uh incident that happened was probably set out in April earlier this year and it's been taking so long I think I'm starting to get a little bit frustrated with like that uh they're not fully putting out like the claims because I don't want this claim to go beyond anything else that is not supposed to be like if the claim is just like a straight out and we shall like that and then we'll get the payment set up but it seems to me that they are delaying. So I don't know it's it's been since April I don't think you should take that long like it's almost the end of the year now. Yeah I understand. So this is for the here in one case is it mister the one where your car was parked there and it was a hit and run, was it that one for this car that's one that's me claiming against the energy went off and then we have, I have a witness will have the number, the number of people like the investigation obviously isn't following up with me for anything, so I don't know what's going on here. Okay. Yeah so usually when you're making a claim against the other party for the case, right? Is your workshop that is doing the claim on your behalf? So for that case you would need to follow up with your work. So you need to tell them, hey, what happened to my case? Are you guys coming from the insurance? Okay? As for the other accident which I'm looking at right now, if you just hold on for me, I'm waiting for the patient. It's the one is it? I believe it's the Earth Street open when the third party of two clothes and collided. Oh no, yeah. Okay. Let me have a look. Mhm. This is the one on two April 2021, one hmm. Inquiry to we have I hated liability inform. Oh wow there's a lot of updates for this one. Hold on what I need to check. Just give me a moment please and sure I need to I need to have clarity, especially for that case because they they sent out an email on that and I've been waiting on to to settle on everything but they they're not they're not getting back on me at all. I see. I'm sorry to hear that. Just give me a moment. Let me have a quick look at the policy type mm mm There's a lot notes on this one. I'll tell you what, allow me to get the claim officer to give you a call back because there really is a lot of uh to and fro and a lot of this for this case uh by looking at the summary of the case, I am really unable to a certain what's the next step or what is the current situation for this claim case? I need to get the I've just got in, I mean like I think a couple of months back um I received an email uh informing that this could be turning into uh personal claim because um the insurance doesn't cover whatever it has happened whatsoever. So I'm like sure, fair enough but I'm just waiting for them to follow up with um like a proper black and white personal came but isn't coming on at all. So I don't want like like you know if any um like extra assessments with me to the car uh with regards to the damages that I did not like cause however it's supposed to be because it's it was, I mean like humidity the lady was at fault by following by the rules and regulations according to the officer investigation officer, like whoever is parking this also like yeah there's a lot of like you said, so I'm just waiting for that to uh be forward to me so I can certainly once cause I wanna close this case and I want to let go the insurance once is that I see? Okay so if you say that you have uh an officer to follow the case with me then that's fine because I'm sorry ma'am I gotta be off for work now so Okay so uh we'll get my claim officer to call you directly instead of your mom is so we'll call this contact number confirming as per the one called in is 9204991. So uh required from the claim officer, is there any is there any way I can get him to call me on my order number, Which number do you prefer us to call you on If I'm gonna be providing you one now (915) 212 76 91 five. Uh huh 212 212 7676. Let me repeat that 91521276. Yes correct. Okay um So the thing that is required from our end to concern if can slim from the policy cash because from my notes I noticed previously right, this one um happened because the previous policy before the renewal, it was actually for a let me see the one that is previously, yep it's a classic plan, yep, the classic plan that was without the anyone to drive your car, right? So this part I can see from the case claim and I noticed that after that the action chicken home inform we have appreciated liability, submit survey report on on the basis on repudiated liability liability, which means that the claim officer confirming that we cannot uh cover for it. Okay. Yeah. Yeah, correct. I noticed she did send one to you as well. Uh let me no claim requested them to some meal survey report team. Okay. So let me retrieve that from my system. If I could see. So at least I know what I really I'm really sorry, but I've got to be right now, so uh yeah, if there's any then just maybe get him to call me on the number one I've given you earlier. Okay. Okay. Just trying to make a call to the number that was uh I'm more active on the second number. That's why I see. I'll give the number. I asked him to try the one that you've given to me first.

Um There's been a bit of a change in the travel so is it okay to cancel the travel insurance and then repurchase it. Uh Yeah you can either do that or can depending on how what is the gravity of the change? Is it moved to a much later date or something? Um It's been extended extended? Oh so you mean the policy already started? Can I maybe I'll give you the insurance policy? Sure go ahead. I see your policy number can Okay I see it S 7301963 Z.

Okay and how many people are insured inside the policy? 2, 2 people. Yeah. Alright and lastly your email address please Caitlyn pong at gmail dot com. Alright thank you. So okay looking at the insured, I found a matching insurance policy so indeed 26 to 8 so you mean instead of uh until eighth uh it needs to be extended to uh much I'm actually leaving leaving past midnight on the 27th now change of flight uh So there is a need to move move and um let me see Red returning on on the 10th I think. Let me take a look. Uh Okay then uh yeah if there is a change of uh uh flight details or itinerary Yeah you can uh I mean to make it much cleaner instead of because we can also raise a request for endorsement but it may be quite confusing because there will be an moving of start date as well as an extension, right? Because from the original trip duration of 13 days. So maybe it would be better to just uh by the replacement policy with a new your new travel uh details. And then uh you can uh cancel the the the first one you bought since it hasn't started yet, you can get full refund for the premium and uh of course subject to no claims. You're not submitting any claims against the policy has been traveled. Yeah yeah because uh for uh yeah you just need to highlight that uh it's subject to no claims and uh it cannot be reinstated in in case you change your mind and wants to use the policy again. So you can just log in uh to cancel that right after you we would suggest you buy the replacement policy first so that you can just be sure that you have the insurance in place and then you can log into your online account. Did you activate it before Caitlyn? No. Oh you did not let me just double check. Oh you did actually, you did, you did uh you did and then on the online account is tagged to the your I see.

       " \"I'm speaking, how may I assist you? Hi sorry who's that? Uh My name is pam P. A. M. Hi, my name is okay, how can I assist you? I have a um I received emails for some change of policy with W. D. Can you help me track if it has updated it correctly for the coveted coverage as well coverage. Okay. Alright so for this answer in order for me to pull out the record in our system, can I know sir, which policy do you have with FW D. Uh travel travel insurance? Okay, do you have the okay let me just uh pull out the person sir uh for the travel insurance sir, when is the travel date that you have provided? It's 18th December 2021 November 18 December December December. So for this uh the contact number sir that you have provided uh during the time that you have purchased, is it the same contact number? Yeah. 97281882 9728 1882. Okay hold on let me just pull out the record in our system for a moment. Okay and just to do a simple verification with you can I have your contact I mean your date of birth? Uh 23rd july 1975. Okay and how about the last four characters of your 2398 and lastly sir, what is the coverage that you have selected the travel region outside of us outside of us? Okay, thank you very much. So for this one sir you have purchased a new policy is it can you hold on Because upon checking so you have this COVID-19 coverage. And what is the changes that you have done on your policy? See originally I purchased a single policy I looked up and they said you can only buy covered for single travel policy. So I went and bought a single travel policy first. Now I put in a start date of 18 december. I thought the single travel is like a normal one month. I did not put any end date. Anyway, I made the payment, it was very small payment of something like $32 or something for maybe it was just one day, right? And I did not know it was only for one day, but anyway I did that policy and then I added on a covered policy for which I think I paid another $88. Okay, so it also attached to the same policy for one day, probably that once it was done after that I realized that it's actually ending on the same day it starts. But my travel plans in Europe extended second or third of january. Okay. Alright. And so I went in 19th of november, I made the changes to extend the single policy to go from you know, 18 december till third of january asked me to pay 1 $15 more. I made the payment to pay, it did not recognize anything, it did not update any statements, just five minutes back, I received an email from wd that finally it has been updated, although if I go to the website and put in my login id as of now it is not showing any updates to my policy, but if I download the policy document of 8898 policy number, it is showing that my travel policy has been updated to but that's the main policy for which I paid $152 extra. Now the add on was with for Covid now is the add on for Covid valid for the same period as a travel, so I don't have to pay any extra or do I have to pay extra for covered? Also that's my question. Okay, Alright so for this because we have notified you that we have already received your payment, so upon checking the coverage that we have here, firstly that the check first when it comes to your travel insurance, at least we can check it one by one. Okay, Alright so for this upon checking the travel insurance that you have with us with the policy number ending with 898 okay, the coverage period that I have here sir is december 18th 2021 until january 3 2022 which is correct. Right, alright and then let us check right now when it comes to your travel insurance to make sure that everything is okay. Okay, can you check if the coveted covet is also for the same period because I did buy the add on Covid policy, right, that's what we need to check now. Alright sure sure hold on. Alright so upon checking for this one sir, the policy coverage for the travel insurance with the COVID-19, this one is actually ending with the same date of the start date, which is November 18, 2021. Okay how do I change this? Do I have to go onto the internet to make the changes? Can I change this? Okay, can you try to log in sir on our W D. S. G. F. So the same thing that you have done with your travel insurance, if you can also extend the policy until the third of january, so while I'm on the line we can also if it will be successful or not, but do I have to pay extra for this again correct? Because I paid I've paid a lot of money already. Yeah because for this one the coverage for your policy is only for one day and then uh of course automatically our system will also generate a premium. If let's say for example we are going to extend the trip duration from December 18 to to january of course that would be a different premium. Your website doesn't even work properly, I'm trying to sign in on the website, it doesn't let me sign it, have you tried using the or the using the app is not working properly? Okay, pretty bad. Okay now I'm on the website going in Okay yes on the website even for the single first policy number 898 ending in 898, it is still showing me the expiry date is 18 december 2021. It has seems like your I. T. Team has not updated actually it is updated already, it's just that since that is the original policy that will be recorded. Right, but you may refer to the email that you have sent you where you can actually download the updated policy sir because that is an endorsement policy already that's why we send you a separate email for that, but it would show me the old date only at the beginning for the for the new email sir that we have sent you right yesterday I believe that one will be an updated period of insurance already. Okay, it's asking me for money and when I click on the website it doesn't let me select that. Why is that okay, is there any other like is there any like pay now grab pay these three options, I click on anything it highlights and then disappears, there's nothing that happens, what do I do? Okay for the for the option of credit card, you cannot also uh select that correct? Yeah it it says first would you like to save your card for future purchase if I say no it takes me to another page. Okay, no matter what I say if I click it's not letting me pay? Okay well what if I cancel all my policies and buy a new one, why don't I do that? Also can also sir, so at least for the one sir, since you have purchased this policy, let me double check. Okay so for this uh 18, since it's still under the feel look right and of course the policy hasn't started yet, so you can actually proceed to cancel the policy and you can purchase a new one with the correct period of insurance er to make it easier, so you're fine. Okay it will take five working days. Do I have to chase uh for that one sir? If let's say for example uh it will be refunded back to the same uh mode of payments or that we use so we didn't find that and working conditions. So I use I think now can you check how did I pay for this? Which one sir for this uh current policy has anything for anything I'm currently checking, can you hold on? Okay so upon checking sir, the payment that you use? Right, it's uh P announcer all the time. Yes correct. Okay now I'm going to, so I requested for a cancellation, does it show in your system so far it doesn't let me double check for you sir? Okay so for the travel insurance and for the coveted travel insurance, it is canceled already it is already reflected in our system, it is correct. Okay so aside from this, is there anything else that I can assist you with? So when when do I get the money back for this one? Since you have used the piano? Right, it will be credited back within 5-5 to 10 business days. 5-10 business, is is there any faster way I'm sorry again sir? Okay so it's asking me again for the same thing $201 to pay upgrade so I being Okay get covered for COVID-19 108.55 up to 30 days before your trip during etcetera etcetera, add cover. Okay I'm adding that cover, let's continue nothing else Next my details, can you just be with me for another one minute? Sure, no problem sir. Okay, Okay asking me for the entire policy about $310 single trip insurance for family of twitter's and two Children traveling worldwide, excluding us in december 3rd january covered proceed to pay. Okay now sorry the service available right now mm Mhm what do I do? Baby the bank so it's not letting me if I need to use the scan right there is another way to do it, is there no number? Okay um for the support mobile banking app that supports scan the Q. R. Code, it's not scanning somehow. Oh is there any other options? Uh no is there any other other options for you to do the payment number number? This normally works? I don't know why it's not working. Okay man, you cannot be okay tend to R A P Y. D. Holdings, is that correct? Yes correct sir. The rapid one, is it correct? Oak seems to have gone okay on your website and training. It's processing. Okay, I got some some details. Maybe this thing should work. Okay. Alright, good to hear. So is there anything else that we can assist you with? No thanks very much. No problem. Thank you very much. And have a nice day. Thank you.

       " \"good evening speaking, how may I help you? Hi, this is juan I want to terminate my contract with about my motorbike insurance. Oh uh may I know the reason one, I'm switching to another insurance company. I see. Okay so your your uh bike is still with you, you're not selling it off but you are transferring to another insurance company, is it? Okay so for this one may I just pull up your details first before I advise you on the process for the termination or cancellation? Sure, no problem. So what's the vehicle number please? S. D. R. 5978 Charlie. Okay one moment. Okay. And one may I know what is the vehicle make and model Yamaha X max 25. Oh okay. And uh what is the email address for your account please? And R I D. W A N. N. P. At outlook dot com. Thank you. Alright, I managed to find the matching policy. So this one you just got it in August this year? Right, August and then Okay, one moment because cancellation wise are you uh can do it through the online portal or the mobile app? Uh But as I can see from here you haven't activated your account. So what I'll do for you uh One is I will send you the uh the link okay to activate and then so that you can log in and cancel it directly through the app because I don't have the log in. That's why you have to do the password first because if you want us to do the cancellation for you. Uh We would need to uh we will need to ask you for a supporting document, which is the new, your new certificate of insurance, so that we can validate the start date as the cancellation effective date. Oh because I I hit the under the understand so uh if you want us to do the manual cancellation for you instead of the direct direct cancellation through the account, Okay, uh you can send over a copy of the certificate, you know the first page that shows the start date of your empty U C. Insurance, uh for the same by number. And then we will use that as a supporting documents for the cancellation. We will raise the request for you to cancel with effect from the start date of your new insurance. Uh how do I go about it? Uh you can email the copy of the certificate through uh contact SG through it. Give me the give me the password, I think uh that one better idea actually that one is the more preferred option because you just need to set up your own password and then you can log in right away, so I'll just do that for you then uh one I'll email it to your outlook, okay, activation email then I will uh yeah you from there once you set up a password, you can simply log in one and then there will be an option to manage your policy and cancel directly any issue You, you can always let us know, then we can always go for the next option. The other work around it really needed. Thank you. Okay. Will that be all for the time being, stay safe then take care. Once again, this is chrisy. Sorry. One. Once\",\n",

O. L. T. At gmail dot com at gmail dot com. Okay. Alright so this is yeah indeed it's uh ending by actually October two for the policy so let me check. Alright because to cancel the policy. Okay. The uh the default or the the one we are advising is to cancel it via the customer portal guess and as I can see from here his I. C. Number uh your dad's I. C. Number is showing us activated so meaning uh he can if he has the mobile app or if you can go to the F wt website when he logged in, there's an option to cancel the manage policy and then cancel the policy password twice. Um there's an option there to retrieve password. Uh It's just that you have to make sure you are entering the correct uh full I see an email address okay to be able to reset the password successfully. So uh can I confirm that also the mobile number, is it the 97934472, is that his mobile? Yes, yes it will be sent to him, that's why you can do it later once because anyway he's the only one who can cancel or must request for cancellation of the policy so as long as uh he's already available you can also choose the date there of the effective date of cancellation. Okay. Uh and then uh you will instantaneously you should be receiving a uh like it will show on the screen also on the any refund amount eligible for canceling the policy early. Okay. Uh that one is subject to no claims and subject to 80% of the unused period, minimum of $26.75. Yeah. Okay. Alright. And then later if uh any issue with the online cancellation and all that? Okay. Uh Alternatively you can ask your uh that to send over a copy of the uh the registration letter from LTA. Okay. And then attach a copy of that and then uh on the email and then send it over to us then we will forward to another team for processing. Alright. Yeah. Okay so you you you just ask him to try first the online because that one is faster because if it's through us, we also need to forward to another team first then you have to wait for three working days and all that. Okay. Alright. Is that all for today or anything else? I can help check that's all Okay. Have an awesome day to you stay safe, take care. Okay. One second this is chrisy. Goodbye. Bye bye.\",\n",

Okay and in order for me to pull out the record in our system. Yeah that would be uh helpful if you have the policy number the um policy number is uh for the Covid 19 1 P. N. T. C. 2021. Okay. Dash 00007490. Okay. Yeah and how about for the other one the travel insurance, the other one is um P. E. N. T. R. 2021. Okay. 1001. Okay 26,790. Mr Jonathan. And the one who spoke with you quite similar. Hello? Uh so you haven't received any any policy yet or you have received the policy received the activation email. So uh what I tried to do was to go on to F wt website to uh to create an account but when I keep my details they say that um it's invalid. Okay because uh for this one you need to activate first, you need to wait for the online services account but uh because you mentioned you need also to have the copy of the policy document, right? Without password, as you mentioned actually for this one, what you can do is let's say for example you have already downloaded it, then you can save your own copy sir without the password, so that is the one another option that you have. So I tried to save it without password. Uh I I tried to save you as a new document, it still has the password and I cannot remove it without uh being in another password that probably already has, which I don't because for this one sir, from us from Fw dsm from the online services account. Right, we really need to encrypt the policy because this is also for the protection of your uh details. Okay, so what you can do right if let's say for example how about if you save it one by one, so would it be okay or no sorry? Uh you you're saying that saving S okay let's say for example let me just check on my end for a moment. Can I know what is your email address by the way? J O N. Okay. C H A M M for Malaysia. Okay 72 The numbers okay. At gmail dot com. Okay sir, by the way, what is your date of birth again? 11 August 1991. Okay and hold on because I'm trying to open the policy on my end also. And how about for your last four characters of your n. r. IC. Uh 624 G. Okay can you hold on let me check for you, So that would be 1991. Can you hold on let me just try it on my end. Okay. Have you tried to also print it on your answer meaning printed on pdf um print on pdf so Alright bye. Are you using your phone or No I'm using a computer actually. Okay. Okay good. Um I'll try this I'm afraid I think it will be it will still require a password because I just tried it on my end. Okay. Okay for this one sir you need to have the policy without the password because you're going to forward it to. Yeah uh like I need to forward it to Thailand, I had to forward it to Thailand how can you hold on? Okay because uh for this one you can what the option that you have so you can actually wait for the online services account activation email and then the other one if it will be okay for you because you can inform also the the because the agency from that you have uh also protected this we can actually provide them the with the password or because I'm just wondering about that accepted so um Okay so I'm just trying to to understand uh when I'm on FWd website um there is this option received, um if you can't find your activation email, you can get it again here, so I click that and keeping my information. Um but uh because for the ones that you haven't activated your account, is this your first time buying your policy with wD or have you already bought a long time ago, but I don't remember opening account with with wD that's why, you know, I'm not sure if they think that I have a policy I find that I found the online services account, activation, email, let me just uh try to send it to you once again for a moment.

       " \"good afternoon speaking, how may I help you? Hello. Hi hi hi I'll need to check on our policy. Mhm. What policy is this is a travel insurance? Okay sure. So what's your policy number? Okay I I have two policy number, one of it is P. N. T. Okay P. E. N. T. C. C. P. N. T. C. 2021-00002334. Uh four zeroes. Right 40. Okay. Alright one will do for now. Uh may I know how may I address you please? I'm Fadela. Okay thank you for give me a moment to retrieve ya. Yeah sure thank you. Uh sorry is it 2234 or 2334 Me too. 2334 2334 And there are four Zeros on there. Yes. Okay sure thank you for let me see here. So uh what what are the what's the nature of your enquiry first. Okay so I would like to take actually when you purchase this inquiry Germany but because of recent issue right? Uh we will be changing destination and one of the person in this policy will no longer be going for the trip. So I would like to do, I'm checking it, can we cancel in person and then change destination or must we cancel the policy and again? Oh okay alright uh actually let me check on the policy details first before I advise you, okay on the best way to uh to take. Okay may I know what is the how many people in total actually Uh for your insurance for this insurance? For 5, 5 people? Yeah. And the travel dates please? 15, 15 5th december to 15 december. Uh Okay and alright you said just now uh Okay. Uh What about the email address you have registered please? Uh Fadela underscore at yahoo dot com. Thank you. And last four characters of your. I see. Okay, so you're also one of the insured? Right? So meaning you're one of them. Okay. Alright so I see here the rest of the insured. Okay so since the policy is uh Okay only by 5th december. Okay because of the changes, right, there are two changes you you need. Okay and it cannot be a removal of the insured may not be possible to uh as a valid amendments on the insurance. So um but I mean the Germany wise it's where are you going now? I mean what's the new destination? It still falls under the same category. So actually no need to change change region because the region you have chosen before is because we we doesn't go by country, it's by region. So your chosen region is world excluding uh usa so as long as you're not going to us, any part of the U. S. Or transiting there then no need to change actually. But because of the but the because of the removal of one person, right? Uh I it would be best to actually buy an entirely new policy with the intended insured so that it will be uh Yeah. And then uh anyway it's only by is there any change on the dates also because one of the person, I mean she's not well so we decided because now you know, understand the change and destination destination, I understand, I completely understand that. So uh yeah, so that would be a better way to go since it's uh it's still uh quite a long, I mean a lot of weeks to go before the cancellation of the policy. Okay. For cancellation wise, did you uh the easiest and most convenient way? Uh fastest way is through the online portal. Have you activated your online account? Uh No, I did not know what to do by the phone for over the phone, is it actually I don't have the authority to do cancellation. We can only forward it to the policy servicing team. So that's why uh if if you want that option it's okay I can forward it to the policy servicing team but uh it will take longer than 2 to 3 working days for you to receive a confirmation that it's processing. Yeah, so that's the one of the difference. So if you want urgent or immediate cancellation uh we advise that because there's like a cancel button when you log into the online account and you can see already the confirmation email that it's been canceled should be uh should be within the next 5 to 10 minutes after you click on the so I customer portal, I sign up for the I sign up on my own is actually no, we already said we should have already sent you the activation email, uh by the way, when did you, when was this the email? Um but then what what do you mean? Because when I see the email right. The only the only right like we can download the policy document but it's a separate one. Uh it should be the title is your online services account, but that one is only being sent to uh to uh first time policyholders with uh let me check on your records, Let me help you out. Okay. You give me a moment, yeah, thank you. So I need to go by or I see. Okay. Oh okay. I see that you have also purchased a travel insurance in 2018, your eyes is included. Uh so it was sent then a 2018. Uh so then since you did not activate it then it already expired for the link, so I'll just send you a new one but I have forward, yeah, I'll have to forward it from uh different email or do you still have access to the M. D. Underscore North? Oh you still have yes, yes, it will be sent to that email but if you want to change it to something else later then you can do so after you log in. Okay, okay so that one is good then the customer service uh Yeah the online uh cancellation is a faster way to do it uh since you will immediately see the confirmation. Yeah so let me just hold on now you give me a moment to check again. I'm just trying to generate a new one. Oh but that time you also uh you also purchase with other people, other people. Yeah. Uh huh let me see number I am trying to check because it's a different I see I see numbers we usually travel so the moment good for you. I I also a fond of traveling but I'm quite scared still to travel these days. Yeah I'm gonna wait a bit more. Maybe let me see because the email that I saw here is addressed to, I'm not sure why but who is this? Uh I don't know the name, it's just the email is addressed to that person but the email address is yours the the the okay sir I'll try to uh send a new one to this one.

Right so I just from there, click from there just is automatically I can make changes to the policy from the uh you can yes there's a you will see first the policy number okay and then under your active policies and then there will be a managed policy option and then cancel the cancel option then after that when you want to purchase, I just buy the new one, just like how previously purchased online, Right, Yes correct. Yes you can just do the same thing uh even now also can and then you can do the cancellation once you receive the activated your online account. Okay, so once you uh uh yeah if you if you encounter any issues or errors but they let just let us know. Yeah, so we can uh you sent to the you sent to M D on this call and you are, I am right, it should be should be sent to that one um but it's not it's not because it may be email traffic whatsoever but I just on the recent word okay, can you hold on let me try to refresh. Thank you so much. No problem. You are on hold mm Hello, thank you for waiting actually I think it has been for some reason it's been rerouted to your new email. Can you try the new email instead, which new email your uh underscore, Yeah that one okay sure. Do you want me to wait on the line as you try to do the activation or can manage from here now?

Uh uh Hi good afternoon because I'm calling uh regarding my uh car insurance that bought earlier this year because I've been buying duty for the previous two years or so. So this year will be the third year. So I realized that the coverage is wrong because just now I tried to renew my my uh my text right then insufficient thinking how come so I realized that uh this is earlier by a month. Okay uh let me just check your policy 1st may I get your vehicle number S I have Singapore London film. Yes correct. 2748 2748 P. T. For Thailand I know peaceful. Uh Yes correct. Uh let me check.

Yeah Sean okay let me just check for you give me a moment. Sure so currently your policy expiry date is 21st of january 2022 for you to be able to renew your text for six months period, you need to have the policy until 21st of february 2022. Yeah correct so it's about one month so uh what you can do is to extend the policy um because we can no longer change the date but what you can do is to extend the policy until 21st of february, 2022 how you can do that is actually via the customer portal via D F W D S G F. Okay. Under manage policy, there's an extension uh extended ended. Okay. So meaning uh using the app, is it uh that's correct using the app or the customer portal from the website Customer? Okay, let me recall your login. If you cannot remember your login, right, or you can click on uh retrieve password, they will ask for your full email address and you just click submit and then reset your password? Okay, sure. Alright. Alright. You're welcome. Is there anything else in the meantime I can assist you? Oh okay. No, no, so so sorry the other thing would be because uh my previous two other policies, we always have been on the february, so that means this time, I mean something was wrong meaning correct could mean that you selected the start date wrongly s 22nd of january I believe because you purchased it on the top of january meaning on the same month. Okay. Okay. Okay, so then that that can be okay. Got it, got it extend, sorry, sorry then we extend right then how do they calculate the extended month? Uh it's based on the premium that you paid, so depending on how many number of days extended. Yeah, so based on the number would be extension immediate. Okay, so once you extend? Right, yes it's immediate, it's just that um, you will receive the device policy via email. We will then transmit the information to them if you pay today because today is a friday. Uh, it's nearly six p.m. So we will only transmit on Monday so you can try to renew the road from Monday on what? Okay. Great. Okay. Thank you. All right. You're welcome. Thank you so much.

Um I took out an insurance, a travel insurance policy and no matter which way I try and log in or retrieve or anything, it doesn't let me um get into it during uh with the app, I've got an email um and I've got a policy number but we've also cancelled our trip and moved it to the summer. So I wondered whether I can either cancel or amend the details and and change it to the new travel dates. Okay? And by the way how may I address you, just in case we get disconnected, can I please have your contact number? Sure. 9233 6826. Okay. Can you hold on let me just check for you for a moment. Please stay on the line. You are on hold. You are on hold. Thank you very much for patiently waiting mister Adam and I do apologize for the long haul. So in order for me to pull up this record in our system can I have the last four characters of your N. I. C. Uh yep it's um 610 G. For golf. Oh but how is that your number or you have used number instead of the let me check. Oh did I book this before? No I booked this after I got my sin. I've changed the pr but I'm sure I booked it with my pr number and not my old thin but I can give you that it's um my old phone number was uh 215 T. Okay, thank you. And how about the last four characters I am in the date of birth, sorry, sorry, 21 June at three. Uh What date sorry? 21 June 1983. 21st January 1983. Can you hold on for a moment?

Family type of insurance. The actually said the details that we have here is still your phone number and also for your date of birth, it is also incorrect. Okay well that's been wrong. 21st 1993. Yeah, because the one we have in our system is 1313 Is what the 13 June 13, 1983. Maybe when you purchased the policy sir, when you have entered the details you've entered it wrong. D but don't worry for this one regarding the policy sir, your travel dates will change right? Yeah, so we want to change the original. The problem is I originally booked an annual policy and then I was told the annual doesn't include the cover cover so I need to book a single trip, so I canceled the annual cover and booked a single trip. And then now we've had to cancel the trip and so we've we've moved the flights to june july next year. So what it's a longer period so it'll be more expensive but I would ideally like to change the dates and just pay to um and I'm I'm well and then also I've booked a trip in March as well so um I don't know whether I go to an annual one but if I could just change the dates and pay the difference. That would probably be the easiest way forward. Oh because uh for this one it's quite very long. One moment.

Right, why? Uh the policy document? Yes, that is the welcome email. Uh you did not receive no. And then the second one is for me to enable to use the correct Okay, this is actually on the same email Yeah, it's actually on the same email but before you can access that there is a separate email sir, that we have sent you to activate now. No worries. Let me forward, let me retrieve the email now so that I can forward that you this one here is another issue portion where I can enter my number and then the day of year just the year, year of birth? Yes correct. Yes correct. Yeah, I download pdf but it keeps saying error, I can't I can't open it, do you have access to it now and then I guide you on how to open may I confirm? Okay, just want to confirm sir, when you enter the password for the pdf file, did you use the password open open? Okay. Uh my my wife managed to send me the email because oh okay, I can change for the second email, can you send it to me? Yes sir, I'm actually in the process of retrieving it now I'll forward you the online activation email in a bit. Okay so for this particular one, once you manage to activate, Okay by the way when you receive the email, it will ask you to enter a password. So since this is your first time you can create your own password. Uh it must be a minimum of eight digits and then a combination of capital and small letters and a number. Okay. Yes. Uh simple also can include as well so when you uh once you have created sir you can log into your online account. Okay, this one even you can just go directly to the fW D uh websites or there is a log in button and then from there there was uh once you managed to log in, you can actually click under manage policies and then uh you can submit the request to update the date of birth only. Okay, so there's an option for you to do that, but at least whenever you need to access your documents, manage your policy would be able to do it uh once you have activated the account sir, so I'm going to forward you the email uh in at least five minutes, so you should be able to receive it now so that would be great aside from this area. So by the way once you manage to activate online, okay, uh usually within one or two working days you will receive a revised certificate that will reflect your correct date of birth. Okay. Okay okay can I ask you about something about this personal accident policy brief information is normally like my wife and my daughter, my daughter, she fell claim medical fee or Okay let me check accident accident yes. For accidents or uh you're under your plan. Okay. Uh your wife actually purchased the 500,000 plan. Okay so for yourself, Okay uh in terms of medical inpatient or outpatient expenses because of an accident you're covered up to $10,000 for the child is half of the benefit, it's up to $5,000 for inpatient and outpatient expenses because of an accident. And then uh this one aside from accident, the policy also includes a coverage for uh infectious diseases. Okay uh but there is a waiting period of 90 days. Okay so if let's say for example there is a medical expenses incurred because of an infectious disease, like maybe a Covid 19 I have to go for inpatient or outpatient treatment then this benefit is entitled to 50% of the benefit you are claiming for. So if let's say for adult that because of covid 19 medical treatment, then the 10,000 it will be uh to 50% so 50% of 5000 coverage for yourself for infectious diseases for the child, it's 2500 coverage for infectious diseases. So by the way um I've already forwarded the email to you sir, would you like to check if I stay on the line for us? Sure. Sure, sure, no worries. Thank you. That's awesome. So from there sir, just have to click on the link to activate it and then as soon as possible sir, please submit your request to actually update the from the inside, by the way. Just to share with you as well. Mr ALF in for the Covid 19. The infectious disease coverage I mentioned to you other infectious disease there is a waiting period of 90 days but Covid 19 we cut down the waiting period to 15 days, so it's much harder for the coverage I'm just curious about aside from this, is there anything else I can help you with?

       " \"wd good afternoon, this is speaking, how may I assist you? Hi, good afternoon, I recently bought travel insurance policy from FW D. But I just wanted to um check whether did I get the coverage uh because I realized that the coverage is an add on? Right. Yeah, so can you help me check if um that writer was added into my policy because I think I was rushing through, so I'm not sure if I if I edited on can I have your name sir? You are uh my name is Mr Jeffers, could I confirm your full name and date of birth? Uh Mama Jeff have been up to lock 30th April 1990. And just to confirm is the start and end of your trip. My start date is 29 November, my end I believe is seven January. Okay so from what I could see for your current travel insurance from five August until sorry bear with me that's not coming from the 29th november until the seventh of january 2022, it actually exceeded the 40 day period as such, we are not able to add on and cover for the Covid 19 coverage. It will not cover for any Covid 19 related uh situation so I can recommend is that is to log into your online account to process the cancellation, full refund for your policy. Bear with me while I check if your account was activated to process the cancellation. Alright yep Once I cancel the policy I can book um the full refund will be back to the same card, useful payment, I would recommend you check with other insurance company because your trip is more than 30 days and for the COVID-19 writer to be added in it has to be 30 days and below. Oh okay why why Because our underwriters and actually as far as management has looked into it and that's where um they have come to the conclusion that 30 days is the maximum we can cover for COVID-19-related trips, and travel it may be revised um in the future but as of now it still Spence So okay so what happens if I were to adjust at in the COVID-19 for 30 days of the of the policy uh it will be considered invalid because even if you are just the dates for example you declare 10 days lesser instead of seven january, maybe you put about 27 of December, therefore the two days of the trip, right? Um but the date you return is seven of January, it will avoid the whole contract because the end date is not accurate as per your boarding class so we will not be covering it. Okay so the coveted 19 coverage is uh specific to um if I get coveted overseas or once I if I get it if I'm back is it is is that how that works Um how it works, is that if your trip is less than 30 days and your diagnosis, COVID-19 in Singapore itself, you can submit a claim for cancellation if you're diagnosed overseas. Oh here I'm sorry, overseas if you're diagnosed overseas will cover $400 300,000 Singapore dollars medical expenses uh for your medical expenses incurred overseas as well as when you come back to Singapore, It's 100,000 Singapore medical expenses coverage. Alright, But having said yeah, go ahead, go ahead. I would recommend that you check other insurance company because I think they are this will cover up to 50 days or 40 days for the travel. So it's just follow FWT specifically currently we only cover 30 days. Okay, okay, so that means the current policy I have with you guys for the travel insurance only covers it covers my entire trip without the benefit. Right? Yes. Okay. And which means uh if let's say if I were to get medical assistance overseas, you still will cover me, but as long as I believe is that what you're saying? Yes, that's correct. Mr jeffers, but having said that it's best for you to check with uh travel insurance because it's not just the medical expenses that could occurred, you say for example you are diagnosed touch with if I'm diagnosed with Covid 19 in Singapore, I will have to cancel my trip all together, which means the hotel, the flight activities you pay for, you need to send me for that. So usually for travel insurance it does cover for that, it's just the four hours in particular, we don't have the coveted portion of it for this travel. Yeah, so I would still recommend that you check with other insurance company, you still have time um as long as you activate your account, which I'm gonna get you how to do so now because I notice you haven't activated yet Just bear with me on that and then later on you can log in in your in your convenience as per your convenience to cancel the policy if you manage to get a travel insurance with other insurance company that covers for your 14 day trip. All right, okay and um I noticed that when I booked this policy online, there wasn't any alert to tell me that yeah, so that that is not on my end, right? Because I think if that was then I would have seen it, but I think my payment went through and everything went through, it's just that when I wanted to print out because I'm traveling with my wife and she had a lesser than 30 days. So that's why she got to like documents to print. We had one, that's correct because um for this one right in relation to that, uh the page actually has the part this is this does not include Covid 19, but that's not in the main page is actually on the second page when you generate the code, This is the COVID-19 outbreak, considered a non event and when you for example got the trip, which is more than 30 days, there will be no an option available for you to click on to top up for so I think that's what happened for this policy Yeah. Okay, so what I'll do for you, I'll get you how to activate your account uh if you have time and in front of your pc can we do it together just to make sure you are able to activate it with our areas? Yeah, sure. I'm at your website right now, let me see first policy was purchased recently Okay, let me check, yeah, and can I verify your email address as well at Hotmail dot com. Okay, I'm checking for the activation email, Let me see when was this purchase? This was purchased nine of November this couple of days ago there we go, I need to put you on hold because I'm looking for your activation email. Alright, just a short moment thank you. You are on hold, you are on hold, you are on hold, you are on hold, thank you for holding. So sorry to put you on hold okay um forward the activation email to your email address. Mr java, could you kindly check if you receive any email from me, it will be sent from contact SG yes, that's the one as your corporate contact and if you can just scroll down to the um email that says customer portal Manager policy of East. There is underlying here, which is orange in color. You need to click on that uh Sure it's under my signature. Where do I find it again? The signature if you see stay safe and healthy. Always wishing you awesome. We go ahead, that's my signature. Right. If you scroll below uh there will be another email there. Uh Yeah. Okay. So if you see the orange color here that's underlying there, just click on that and you should be diverted to our website to set up a password you can remember. Uh Yes, I'm so just set up your password, but then it's just a normal like a website that I would go in. Yes, it looks like that, but you need to set up the password first by setting up the password, you're activating your online account. So that later on when you want to cancel your policy or you want to check your policy or submit a claim, you can log in to the FW online account or the FWD mobile app. Okay. Uh am I supposed to see uh a problem that um and password or something like that, uh once you get, it will be activated here. New password, confirm, password? Oh no, I don't see that. Okay, so what I see in your signature, right is your name and then the stuff and then there's a there's like a picture that tells me purchase a manager policy through FWD and then below that I see, email us your contact number and call me back, I don't see uh the okay you found it. Alright awesome, awesome. Okay so I just have to type password right? Mhm. Just give me a second, no worries, take your time. Okay so I received a P. Okay let me put that in. Okay. Yeah so um so I click on my policy under my policy, you will see your travel insurance there. So when you're ready to cancel it, for example if you manage to find Other insurance company that covers for the full 40 day trip. And they also include COVID-19 benefits as well. You can actually click on manage policy Okay and then cancel so once you click cancel, right, the process is immediate, you will get a pop up to say uh filling the reason of cancellation, like not traveling anymore. Um found better coverage elsewhere. Example and then uh if as long as the policy has not started yet and you have requested for cancellation, The process will be immediate usually within like five minutes or so you will receive a cancellation confirmation email to say that this policy has been cancelled, refunded back to the same card, useful payment and pretty much uh we believe that the amount should show on the same day in your card details how we cancel uh things that we buy online, the credit amount immediately back to our car, it should be so unless of course your bank will take a bit longer to process such refund request. Alright okay and you're saying that um if I were to cancel this before the policy starts, which means that until the 28th of november 28th of november to actually do so if you want to be sure because um sometimes customer have issues logging in and things started and 28 is actually a Sunday if you call us uh you might not be able to come through to us because we don't work on sunday, I would recommend just to make sure everything is fine. Try to do the cancellation on friday which is 26 we are here nine in the morning until 10 in the evening. If you have issues logging in, we can still put in a request from outside but it will take two working days to process. That's all Okay I understand. Uh Can I also clarify that the coveted um Writer right is mandatory only for those with any of the vitale flight? Uh We believe it's best to have because it's not just a matter of going on V. T. L. Flights even if it's not a V. T L. Uh country right? We still cover there's more in the event touch wood if the insured is tested positive for Covid 19 right so that's the reason for in mm Okay Okay um Alright okay yeah sure thank you so much.

       " \"good afternoon speaking, how may I help you on how to make a claim on my students personal accident? Okay, let me uh assist you on that ma'am. May I just have your uh details first? I can check for you. Thank you. Okay what's your I see your policy number ma'am. Uh my number is S. 7400531. D. For Denmark 531. Okay how may I address you Just you can just call me Pc or miss. Thank you. All right thank you. Miss lee one moment. Personal accident. Okay. How many people are insured inside your personal accident policy myself? On yourself And your uh email address is pola at uh Hotmail dot com. Thank you. What about your uh do you remember your sum assured for your personal accident? I think it's 100 K. 100 K. Okay thank you so much. I found your matching policy. So uh you mentioned you need to submit a claim, is it uh like a medical for outpatient medical expense? Yeah that's right. Because what happened is i this is my actually my first time uh cleaning after so long uh this last saturday this last day I have a fall and actually my my arms and my hands. I'm sorry to hear that. Thank you very much. That's why I went to a polyclinic because I have a follow when I went to uh you can get everything close. I need to go on a Tuesday. Tuesday uh Tuesday to do extra, so Tuesday I went to do X ray. Uh luckily quite quite quite likely they say there's no factor or anything good. Yeah but the issue is uh I'm still suffering from pain and and and and selling. So I am thinking of going for a second opinion which is uh which is going for another doctor, which is the appointment for tomorrow. This whole thing works and get all the amount and claim or what what am I supposed to do? Alright, submission of claim wise Miss lee it's uh you can submission, the window period is within 30 days from incurring the charge or from the actual accident date so you can uh you can do so you can send the submit the claim first for the initial visits and all that. Uh And then if you have any like follow ups or related outpatient visits for the same accident, you can just submit it later as a follow up claim related to the same accident. So you can just register the claim first for now uh for the one that you finish already, you already have the receipt right? You already paid for the then you can submit it online directly. Uh I'm just checking if you have activated, do you remember logging in before miss lee because I want to because I didn't know that I I just need to have 1% accident but I have 2% accident, different companies I see I just wanted to check whether do I have mm Okay yes so uh since you can log in uh there is when when you see the policy uh reference there, right, there's a submit a claim option so you can just click on that and then uh it will you just fill in the fields required, required and then there would be a recall upload documents section uh and then you can just submit so once that is completed you will also receive on a confirmation email with the claim reference number. So that means your claim already registered and they will uh process it within normally 14 days or uh to a month, depending on the complexity of the claim, could I just show you what what what what documents do I need to to do something other than my receipt to a letter from the doctor indicating that has informed him that came and it was really because of my accident mm Yes uh because if it's not uh normally it's not on the receipt, right? So uh I mean if you do have the any medical related document, I suggest you just submit them altogether but uh later on uh I mean the the main thing is the receipt. Okay but if the claim's officer deems it necessary uh during their processing right to uh to update additional information or clarification on what that receipt is for then they will uh inform you separately with the claim reference also. Yeah but but I would suggest whatever you have for now you just submit together and then uh let's just see how it goes when the processing the claims processing officer uh Yeah checks the documents you have submitted and the details, would you be okay if I left my apartment with another doctor's uh can I just go to that then after that I submit together? Like maybe tomorrow after Oh yeah, it's up to you, as long as as mentioned within 30 days from the incurring the charge, uh you submit and also to avoid to avoid losing the, you know the receipt and all that. So yeah it's but it's up to you if you want to do it tomorrow also can since it's still within the timeframe. Okay that'll be maybe just once but at least you know you know how to go about it already. Thank you. Thank you appreciate your assistance. Thank you very much. Not a problem is leave right now, is there anything else I can check for you? Uh that's why that's why I just wanted to know how this whole power has been so many years but that's something also right. But that's something that means you're not usually having accidents. So feel I hope you are the injury is uh you know, the pain will go away very soon so that you can be 100% again. Thank you very much appreciate that. No worries. Okay. Anyway if anything you just uh call us again, contact us again, we'll be happy to assist you. Okay? Thank you very much. You. Thank you. Bye. Take care, stay safe. Okay. Once again, this is Christy.

       " \"Good afternoon speaking, how may I help you? Hi this is Alexis um I'm calling with regards to a travel related claim, the website and the app is both down. Oh uh so you mean you cannot proceed with the purchase of it uh the claim so uh once I click on submit it will say error and it's the same on the app as well as on the website. Oh okay sorry about that. Uh Okay let let me pull up your details first and then I will advise you on maybe an uh the alternative way to submit the claim since this is uh there's an ongoing issue. Can I have your I see your policy number please ma'am uh my which one policy or I see either one uh so that I can pull up your records. Yeah. Okay. Uh maybe the policy is T. N. T. R. Okay 2021 Alright zero 6464 6464. Thank you, how may I address you ma'am Alexis, Alexis, Alexis. Uh But I mean for the on the policy, how what's your full name indicated? Alexis, Strong India. Okay thank you Alexis. Uh Let me see policy. Alright so how many people are insured inside this policy please? 1 1, okay and the travel period uh is six November to I think 13 or 14 November. I remember how about your email address, Alexis J. At gmail dot com? Alright thank you so much. Alright I found the matching policy, let me just see any reports regarding claim so you tried via the app and the online version but it's the same same, exactly the same area. The submit button after you click, it doesn't go through the next the confirmation page, is that right? Um after I click submit, there will be a pop up that says that there's an error, I can take a screenshot of the app but on the website and there is some api issue yeah the api expired mm. Okay. Alright. Uh Alexis is it okay if uh are you still on the website right now on the in front of a P. C. No but I can be okay yeah because the two other options left would be to submit through the online form without logging in uh because the bug is uh I checked the report and there was a bug reported already for the online access meaning after you log in that particular button indeed is causing some issues or yeah so it's still being fixed by our I. T. Team but the online uh web form uh that's the part where you can just key in first the details, the policy number and your your personal information and then you can upload also the documents from there. Uh Yeah yes can so you just need to go to online right so instead of signing in, you go under claims and then uh there will be uh two options there so click on the don't have an account, click here to get started, yep, yep and then click travel. Mhm. Yes and then click uh which which one you're claiming from under the main travel or the under covet 19. Alright and then uh I'm on this page now but then actually under the policy number um it says P. N. T. R. 20 yep. Then you just continue the 21 21 dash. Oh okay then Okay yes correct. And then uh yes you can just follow the prompts. Okay and then uh this one there's no reported issues with the submit so hopefully it goes through uh uh but maybe I can give you for now I can also give you the last alternative just in case it's uh to email directly to claims team but that one is the last option, last resort because it will take longer for them to register manually, the the claim, so that's that's claims dot S G mm at fwd dot com, mm. Okay. Yeah. Um Yeah and and then I have another related question which is uh for my wallet was actually stolen overseas in Italy. So I came back already I felt a police report in Italy um I've also found a local police report for my I see, so my question is for this travel claim right? Um definitely there was money that was stolen, but there's also I guess my personal belongings which is the wallet and uh the icy and place together token and some credit cards. So with that uh which option can I do multiple claims on the same policy for multiple items. Yes. You can uh you just submit the uh the supporting documents for the items that you're claiming or it would be best if you want to uh to also provide any supplementary, you know, maybe in writing or something like that after you submit the claim and got the claim reference number. Normally they will also review first what you're claiming for uh claiming for based on the, you know, the, the receipts, the police report. Yeah, it will be itemized there anyway. So later on they will uh the claims officer to be assigned to your case will be reaching out Okay. If they need for the clarification or verification, then you can go from Della, there will be a direct correspondence. Direct correspondence with a claims officer. Yeah. And then in let's say in the type of money when you fill in the full sum that I wish to claim or just up to the policy amount that I'm allowed, you can either way is fine. So if it's uh if you can put their the actual amount that has been lost. Okay then you think was lost and then uh later on if they review then they will just pay out is just to let you know that of course, regardless of how much it is, then we'll only pay up to the maximum amount as per that. Okay. Yeah. Um And one last question, I'm not sure whether you know this whether it's under your purview but um let's say I lost my N. R. I. C. And um on a website they say that I have to pay $100 for replacement on the first law, but there was nothing on it about stolen. I see and whether I need to pay for it I've contacted ICA but they have not gotten back because I think right now they are flooded with um all the different issues. So I'm just wondering in the I. C. Replacement cost is that something that can also be claimed? Uh Well because for loss of, I'm not sure if that can be considered because the the I understand that under our policy wording, right, it's just as travel documents, right, passport travel documents but for uh an R. I. C. The personal belongings, personal belongings, uh I would suggest you just send it in together if you if you already have the receipt uh so that they can take that into consideration when processing the claim because outright I cannot advise if it's uh gonna be falling under the category. Yeah. Okay but because the idea is not getting back to me, I I'm not sure whether I should just continue to apply for a replacement and pay for it, so I can get a receipt wait for them. Uh And then I I'm I'm sure whether it might be outside this 14 day period. Um I'm supposed to file the claim so little bit but not necessarily, it's within 30 days. Okay. And uh as long as you have already registered, I would suggest you register whatever uh whatever it is that you are claiming as of now and then the rest can be like a supporting claim or like a related claim already. So as long as you can, as long as you can register your claim first for the within the 30 days period upon your return. Okay. Okay. That's good. Yeah. Okay then uh All clear, I have no more questions. All right. Okay. All right. So you just try no problem. Alexis. So you just try that first and then if uh any issue you can just email directly to the email address just now. Okay. Okay. Thank you. Okay. Alright for now. Anything else, nope. Okay. You take care stay safe and well, Alexis. Bye. You're welcome. Bye.\",\n",

Okay. Uh Singapore London Malaysia. Okay. 3393 Kingdom. Okay, thank you. And Mr 10 just in case we get disconnected while I'm checking, may also ask for your contact number? 91458248824. Okay thank you. Mr let me just put you on hold for a moment. Let me double check your policy. Yeah. Hello, thank you. Thank you. You are on hold. You are on hold. Hi thank you for staying on the line. Okay. Uh just for a quick verification uh May I confirm if uh the vehicle is registered under your name? No, under my wife under the wife's name. Okay just to confirm sir, you are actually trying to uh log in using the wife's account, is it? And I tried to use the mobile trying to do it. Online survey also cannot using the wipes uh user name or is it your own? I see. No, my wife under my wife. Okay, can I confirm sir uh what is the user uh what is the error message that you are getting message again so long? Uh Okay. Uh you see that the id of password? Oh okay. I see um if that is the case, may I confirm uh what is the mobile number uh that you are using your wife is using under the policy? If I know my phone number, confirm, may I also ask for the number of the wife? Okay, the last four digits or whole number? The full digits? three Okay. 1.50427 G. For Germany. Okay, thank you. Uh when you try to log in uh Mr 10 Yuki in 427 G. And then your mobile number, correct? Okay, if that is the case if that is the case where it is possible that it's uh because of the password, if just in case you are unable to remember the correct password sir, are you able to click on the retrieve password button? Just it's just below the password, boxer Captain. Yesterday. Okay, whenever we keep the number, the full the full the full ones including including the S. I. Try my wife, I see. Right. Um Yes. Uh huh The owners and then the email address provided an email address. I tried all these three d. Mhm. Yesterday okay now I submit it is yes sir, that's on my own. Yes sir. Okay, so it's uh a new password? Well the new must be must be minimum of eight digits and then a combination of upper and lowercase letters, number and a symbol or a special character. Oh, so many numbers and special characters. Maybe I opened the password possibly yesterday because the exact details of the policy sir, because of P D P. E. I am not able to disclose but I can guide you on how to do the cancellation? Okay, okay, okay. Open up open so once you are inside Mr Tan uh there was already an option for you to submit the cancellation of the policy. So just to share with you Mr 10 for the policy sir, once it's cancelled, uh you will also receive where the policy holder will receive an email notification or confirmation into working days. And this was usually uh we will refund 80% of the unused portion. As long as the premium is not below $26.75. Uh but this uh refund is subject to no claims or no benefits paid out under the policy. So if there is any accident or any type of benefit out then there will be no refund provided. Okay so how do I go to cancer cancel this one? Are you able to find the policy? And then is there a button for manage policies? Oh my policy just hold on. Okay then Okay can I just cancel my policy? Right, yes yes correct Last year of coverage today yesterday correct reason for cancellation I got a uh scratch my car Okay mm Okay name Okay So the 80% refund to go to my bank account or what received on my bank account? Okay this ones are usually it's back to the same debit or credit card used to buy the policy but if it fails then it will be uh sent via check to the policy holder's name. May I confirm Mr Tan, is there any claim or benefits paid under the policy? Anyone? Uh it was there any accident or uh any any claim made under the policy like windscreen accident? Nothing in it, no accident. Uh huh. How about windscreen shirt? The screen? I did change one, change one side. Okay. Um because if there is a windscreen benefit paid out sir, uh there will be no refund under the policy as well if it is canceled, did we 11 time front windscreen sir, it will not affect the N. C. D. But it is a benefit that is speed under the policy. So as per the policy wording sir, the terms and condition if there was any type of benefit or claim that is speed under the policy, then there will be no refund in the event uh the policy is cancelled midway. So most insurances would have this terms and conditions regarding things now to get a new car will be able to change to the new car um for the insurance or it's not transferable to uh to any other vehicles for the new car, a new policy would have to be taken up for yet. Oh thank you very much happy to assist you sir. Once again, my name is Irish. You have a good day ahead. Thanks, happy to help. Thank you. Bye Bye. Bye.\"]"
